<blockquote>

<p>One of the most striking characteristics of the Westerner is the high regard in which he holds
womankind. Even in the roughest mining camps a woman is absolutely safe, and is treated with a
consideration unknown in many more civilized centres. This remarkable story illustrates the
Westerner’s innate chivalry in a very striking fashion. Sooner than drag the name of a young
schoolmistress into a quarrel, a resident of Three Corners, Montana, allowed himself to be made an
outlaw, and for weeks defied the population of a whole county to arrest him, even when a field gun
was brought out to shell his fastness. How in his extremity the girl he had befriended came to his
rescue and put an end to this extraordinary “war” is graphically told in the narrative.</p></blockquote>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the extreme western part of the
State of Montana, U.S.A., in the
County of Beulah, lies a little town
called Three Corners. At first only
a junction on the Rio Grande Railway,
from which point countless thousands of
cattle were shipped to all parts of the world,
Three Corners grew to be a flourishing place.
The wooden shanties, gambling “joints,” and
dance halls gave way to brick buildings, several
banks, a school, and other signs of progress, as
respectable settlers moved farther toward the
Golden West. Of course, a part of the old town
remained, and with it a few of the characters
typical of a Western “cow town.” Among
these was a tall, raw-boned man who had drifted
West in the ‘eighties, settling at Three Corners
and opening a gambling-house. His name was
“Jim” Cutler. He was a man of very few
words, but with one great failing&mdash;he would
shoot first and argue afterwards. Yet this gambler,
who was known and feared far and wide as a
“gun-fighter,” was at heart the mildest of men,
beloved by all the children in the town, to whom
he gave coppers galore. Furthermore, Cutler
would put up with all manner of insult from a
man under the influence of liquor, or from
“Tenderfeet” who did not know their danger.
Cutler’s shooting propensities were directed
solely toward avowed “bad men” or those who
delighted in being known as bullies. In the
course of his altercations with such characters
this tall, raw-boned man&mdash;who could, and did,
“pull his gun” like a streak of lightning&mdash;added
to the population of the local cemetery with a
score of six.</p>

<p>Among the new-comers to Three Corners
during the rehabilitation of that town was a
Hebrew named Moses Goldman. This man, a
good-looking fellow of some twenty-eight years,
hailed from New York. He opened a shop, and,
with the business ability of his race, soon succeeded
in making it the principal draper’s establishment
of the place. Before long, however,
reports began to circulate that the handsome
young Hebrew was not quite so respectful in
demeanour towards his lady customers as he
should have been, and, although highly popular
with a certain element, the major portion of
Three Corners’ female population gave Goldman’s
shop a wide berth.</p>

<p>One Monday morning Jim Cutler, who had
been up all night looking after the “game” in
his establishment, was just leaving the place
when a young woman, whom he recognised as
the schoolmistress, ran up to him and said:
“Oh, Mr. Cutler, would you mind walking as
far as the school-house with me?”</p>

<p>Cutler, somewhat astonished, did so, and was
gratefully thanked for his trouble. After leaving
her he walked slowly back to his rooms, wondering
why he of all men should have been
chosen to escort the pretty “school ma’am.”</p>

<p>Some days afterwards Cutler, who passed the
school on his way to and from the Gem Saloon
(his place), saw the mistress deliberately cross
the street just before reaching Goldman’s shop,
and continue on her way on the other side. He
also saw Goldman come to the door and try to
attract the girl’s attention. When he reached
Goldman, the latter; twirling his moustache,
remarked, laughingly, “Shy girl, that, eh?”
Cutler looked at the Hebrew for a moment, and
then answered quietly, as he moved away, “She
ain’t your kind.”</p>

<p>Three weeks after this little episode there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
a ball at the City Hotel, and, naturally, almost
the entire youth and beauty of Three Corners
“turned out.” The City Hotel was just opposite
Cutler’s saloon, and at about one o’clock the
gambler was sitting in a chair outside his place,
listening to the music, when the schoolmistress
and her mother left the hotel on their way home.
A moment later a man also quitted the building
and followed them. Presently he stopped the
two ladies and attempted to converse with them.
The younger of the women apparently expostulated
with him, and then the two went on,
leaving him standing at the corner. Cutler
recognised the solitary figure as that of
Goldman, the draper, and drew his own conclusions.
Next morning Cutler made it his
business to leave the Gem Saloon just as the
schoolmistress was passing, and strode up to
her.</p>

<p>“Miss Thurloe,” he said, “you were stopped
last night on your way home. Can I be of any
assistance to you? I know you have only your
mother to protect you.”</p>

<p>The girl gave him a grateful look, and
explained that Goldman had repeatedly forced
his attentions on her. She had done her best
to send him about his business, but he continually
annoyed her, even going so far as to
enter the school-house, interrupting lessons and
making himself generally obnoxious.</p>

<p>Cutler smiled grimly during the girl’s hesitating
recital, saw her safely to her destination, and
then went home for a sleep. At three o’clock
that afternoon he walked leisurely towards the
school-house, stopped at the fence just by the
rear door, and chatted with the boys, it being
the recess hour. Suddenly, approaching from
the opposite direction, he beheld Goldman, who
walked straight into the school-house without
having seen the gambler. The latter waited for
a few moments, then he also entered the building.
Reaching the schoolroom, at the end of
a short hall, he found the door locked, and
promptly threw himself against it with all his
strength. The door gave way with a crash and
Cutler leapt in, to see the schoolmistress
struggling in the arms of Goldman. She was
fighting like a tigress, but the Jew’s hand, held
tightly over her mouth, prevented her crying
out. Directly Goldman beheld the saloon-keeper
he released his prisoner, who sank back
panting upon a chair, and glared savagely at
the new-comer. Cutler, ignoring him entirely,
walked slowly toward the agitated schoolmistress
and stood still, waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p>Goldman, however, was the first to do so.
“Oh, no wonder I’ve no chance,” he burst out,
viciously; “Cutler’s as lucky in love as he
usually is at cards.”</p>

<p>Cutler flushed at the gibe, but he said not a
word, waiting for the girl to speak. Presently,
having in a measure recovered herself, she rose
and approached the gambler. “Mr. Cutler,”
she said, unsteadily, “this man has insulted me
repeatedly. Just now he tried to kiss me by
force, and I’m afraid I shall have to give up my
position here and leave Three Corners.”</p>

<p>In a very gentle voice Cutler asked the girl
to leave the room for a few minutes. After she
had gone he turned toward Goldman, who
stood looking at him defiantly, his arms folded
across his chest.</p>

<p>“If you were a man,” he said, sternly, “I’d
drop you where you stand, but I’m going to
teach you a lesson that’ll do you a heap of
good.” Then, with a sudden bound, he grasped
Goldman by the throat, threw him across a
desk, and, with a three-foot ruler, administered a
thrashing such as might be given to a recalcitrant
schoolboy, only with somewhat greater severity.
The punishment over, Cutler picked the man
up and, dragging him across the floor, threw
him bodily out of the building. Now Goldman
was himself a powerful man, but Cutler’s action
had been so swift and decisive that the Hebrew
had practically no chance to offer resistance.
Once freed from the gambler’s hold, however,
he turned and flew at his adversary with
clenched fists, snarling furiously. Cutler stood
quite still, and just as the Hebrew came within
the proper distance his right fist shot out
straight from the shoulder. It landed square on
Goldman’s jaw, and he dropped like a log.</p>

<p>Several of the school-children, attracted by
the noise, now crowded round, vastly excited.
Cutler, having informed Miss Thurloe that he
believed she would not be further annoyed,
but that he would keep an eye on “that fool
masher,” walked slowly toward the town, leaving
the vanquished draper lying where he had fallen.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to explain all this in
order that readers of <span class="smcap">The Wide World
Magazine</span> unfamiliar with the ways of the
Far West may better understand what follows.
I have said that the better element had in a
manner of speaking driven the original settlers
at Three Corners to new fields. These new-comers
looked upon Cutler as an “undesirable.”
His reputation as a “man-killer” did not appeal
to the emigrants from the cultured Eastern
States, who would gladly have seen him pack up
and leave the town. Goldman was quite aware
of this, so, directly he recovered himself, he
asked for and obtained a warrant for Cutler’s
arrest on a charge of assault. The gambler was
arraigned before the local magistrate, where he
steadfastly refused to give any reason for the
chastisement he had inflicted upon Goldman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
The latter immediately realized the advantage
of Cutler’s chivalrous reluctance to drag a
woman’s name into the affair, and so swore
that the assault was entirely unprovoked and
committed out of “pure devilry” on Cutler’s
part. Cutler was fined fifty dollars
and severely admonished by the
Court. Everyone wondered why
this acknowledged “bad man” did
not promptly wreak vengeance on
the Hebrew. The gambler, however,
desiring to protect the name
of the school-teacher, said not a word, but paid
the fine and went about his business as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="caption">“HE ADMINISTERED A THRASHING SUCH AS MIGHT BE GIVEN TO A RECALCITRANT SCHOOLBOY.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some ten days passed, when, one moonlight
evening, Cutler came driving down the road
leading into Three Corners, behind a fast-trotting
horse. Just as he reached the end of a long
field of corn a report rang out and his horse
dropped, riddled with shot. Cutler jumped
from his buggy, whipped out his revolver,
and made for the corn-field, from which the
shot had evidently come. He made a thorough
search, but the tall corn-stalks afforded a secure
hiding-place to the would-be assassin&mdash;for Cutler
had no doubt whatever that the shot had been
meant for him. Reluctantly giving up his quest,
he walked back to his saloon and sent several
men to remove the dead horse and bring in his
buggy. The next morning he again made his
way to the corn-field, and there, just by the
fence, he found five discarded cigarette ends of
a very expensive Egyptian brand which he knew
to be smoked by only one man in Three
Corners&mdash;Goldman, the draper. Evidently the
man had lain in wait for a long time. Cutler
next climbed over the fence, and was about to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
return when he saw lying in the path a piece of
cloth torn from a jacket, and on it a button. It
looked as though the would-be murderer, in
jumping the fence, had caught his coat on the
barbed wire; at any rate, he had left a damning
piece of evidence behind him. With the
cigarette ends and the fragment of cloth in his
pocket, Cutler walked leisurely up the road into
the town and made direct for the shop of Moses
Goldman.</p>

<p>The draper was standing on a step-ladder
arranging some goods on the shelves. When
the door opened, ringing a small bell, he turned,
and seeing Cutler jumped down from the ladder.
The gambler looked the man straight in the eye.
“You miserable cur!” he cried, angrily. “You’d
shoot a man in the dark, would you?”</p>

<p>Goldman, realizing that Cutler had satisfied
himself as to the identity of his assailant, made
as if to draw a revolver. That was the last
movement he ever made, for the next instant he
dropped dead, shot clean through the heart.</p>

<p>The gambler waited for a moment to see if
the report of the pistol had attracted any attention;
then, as no one appeared, he quietly left
the shop, went over to his saloon, placed two
revolvers in his belt, and filled his pockets with
ammunition. Then, taking up a Winchester
repeating-rifle, he went to the stable, saddled
his horse, and after a few words with his bartender
rode out of Three Corners in a westerly
direction.</p>

<p>It was not long after his departure before
the entire town was in an uproar. Moses
Goldman, the energetic draper, had been
found shot&mdash;killed in his own shop by Jim
Cutler. The latter had been seen entering
Goldman’s establishment by several persons,
and the shot had been heard by people living
above the store, who afterwards saw Cutler
leaving. Sheriff Benson, accompanied by two
deputies, promptly called at the Gem Saloon,
but the officer was a trifle late, for Cutler was by
that time some miles distant. Lest it should be
thought that Cutler had made his escape through
cowardice it may be best to explain at once,
perhaps, that this was not the case. The man
realized that should he be apprehended the
name of Miss Thurloe must necessarily figure
prominently in the matter. Strange as it may
seem, this six-foot gambler, knowing no better,
believed that by “making himself scarce” he
was protecting that lady’s good name. This was
a mistake, undoubtedly, but the fact remains
that he made it.</p>

<p>It happened that Rufe Benson, Sheriff of
Beulah County, was a sworn enemy of Cutler’s,
for the latter some years before had taken the law
into his own hands and at the point of his gun
liberated a prisoner whom he believed to be
innocent, and who was eventually proved to be
so. Benson now formed a posse of some twenty
armed men, and there began a man-hunt which
lasted, so far as this particular posse was concerned,
for a fortnight. They were then reinforced
by a body of “Rangers,” some fifty
strong, who in turn found it necessary to call to
their assistance a body of militia. All these
officers were ably assisted by the citizens and
residents of Beulah County, altogether some
thousand strong, and yet Jim Cutler proved
more than their match. Benson’s men trailed
the fugitive to Kerry’s ranch, some six miles
out; from here he had gone north-west toward
the Rio Grande. He was mounted on a thoroughbred&mdash;as
were all the men, for that matter&mdash;but
six miles was a long start in a case like this, and
should the hunted man once reach the mountains&mdash;well,
there might be some trouble in
getting at him. The telegraph was put into
operation, and a circle some ten miles in circumference
drawn around Cutler. When this cordon
closed in, however, they failed to find the
gambler amongst them, but they <i>did</i> find two
self-appointed “man-hunters” lying where they
had fallen to the deadly aim of Jim Cutler’s
repeating-rifle.</p>

<p>From every town for miles around amateur
detectives joined the hunt, but no trace could
be found of Cutler beyond the Moulin River,
a tiny stream only some twenty feet wide, so the
rivulet was dammed and the water drained off
for miles, so as to discover, if possible, whether
Cutler had ridden up or down stream. While
one party of men were doing this, others rode
in all directions, searched the ranches, and
notified every town by telegraph to keep a look-out
for the slayer of Moses Goldman. More
and more people joined in the hunt, but for
some days, in the slang of the West, “there was
nothing doing.” Then, early one morning, two
horsemen came galloping towards Benson’s camp,
and one of the men, dismounting, delivered a
message to the effect that Cutler had been seen
at McPherson’s ranch, some eleven miles north-west,
where he had informed Mr. McPherson
that he had not the slightest intention of taking
further life unless driven to it, and that, if
Benson would call in all his men, he (Cutler)
would promise to give himself up in a fortnight’s
time. (It was afterwards learned that he
intended in the interval to communicate with
Miss Thurloe and arrange a story, leaving her
name entirely out of the matter.) Benson,
however, was on his mettle, and so refused
to parley with his quarry.</p>

<p>“If Jim Cutler thinks he can defy the law
and officers of this county, he is mightily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
mistaken,” he said, “and we’re going to take
him, dead or alive.” This ultimatum duly
reached Cutler through “non-combatant”
friends, whereupon he smiled grimly. Being
now outlawed, it was impossible for Cutler’s
friends to assist him without making themselves
amenable to the law, so the hunted man
demanded and secured everything he required
at the point of the pistol.</p>

<p>Within fourteen days thereafter nine men who
had attempted to interfere with the escaping
gambler paid for their foolhardiness with their
lives, and all the time, little by little, Cutler was
getting closer to the mountains, whose shelter
meant so much to him. Sometimes hidden for
hours in a haystack, or lying flat under the
rafters of a barn loft, the fugitive moved on his
way. The main body of pursuers often got
within gun-shot of him, but luck favoured the
man, and he always managed to find cover just
in time. Finally, completely worn out&mdash;he had
ridden two horses to death and abandoned
others commandeered for the time being&mdash;Cutler
reached the foot of the scrub hills or
little range which lay between him and his goal.
Here, for the first time, he came in contact
with a number of the “man-hunters.” “Lon”
Masters&mdash;a noted character in Montana, and
himself a dead shot&mdash;accompanied by eight
cowboys, suddenly appeared over a rise in the
ground. Cutler, on foot, saw them coming.
He dropped on one knee and his rifle flew to
his shoulder. The horsemen drew rein, and
Masters, making a trumpet of his hands,
shouted, “Don’t be a fool, Jim; you’re sure to
be caught sooner or later. Let me take you, and
I’ll promise no harm shall come to you. You
know my word.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Can’t do it, Lon,” Cutler shouted back. “If
they give me ten days without interference I’ll
give myself up&mdash;you know <i>my</i> word.”</p>

<p>“Jim,” responded Masters, “if you don’t
drop your gun we shall have to fire.”</p>

<p>“Crack! crack! crack!” came the answer
from Cutler’s gun, Masters and two others of
the party being hit. The remainder now urged
their horses forward, but, as first one and then
another rider was “winged” by the desperate
man in front of them, the remainder decided
that they had urgent business elsewhere, and
rode back for reinforcements.</p>

<p>At last, after a weary night’s climb, Cutler
reached the place he had been making for. He
had not slept more than an hour or two for
days, and so, secure for a time at least&mdash;for no
one could climb these hills quicker than he had
done&mdash;the worn-out man dropped in a heap.
Cutler’s hiding place was a barren ledge, some
fifty yards in extent, the only approach thereto
being the bridle-path by which he had come.
Two, or at most three, at a time was the only
formation in which his pursuers could get anywhere
near him, and with Cutler’s knowledge
of the use of firearms this was a ticklish undertaking,
to say the least of it. Moreover, he
could see anyone approaching along the valley
for a great distance. There was plenty of water
a little distance down the path, Cutler had
sufficient food with him to last for a week, and
he felt he could “make a get-away” during
this time.</p>

<p>The erstwhile gambler awoke when the sun
was high in the heavens; he felt lame and sore
all over. Walking towards the edge of the
ledge he saw, away in the distance, a large
party of horsemen spread out over a great area.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
Cutler went down the path, bathed his face and
arms in the cool spring water, and took a long
drink; then, returning above, he sat down and
leisurely ate from his store of dried beef,
biscuits, and corn bread. At midday the
approaching horsemen were in full view, and
Cutler saw that they had come with prairie
wagons, containing camp paraphernalia,
evidently prepared for a siege, for they knew as
well as he did himself of the hiding-place where
he had taken refuge. Soon the riders came to a
halt and Cutler laughed as he saw others coming
from all directions, evidently anxious to be
“in at the death.” It looked rather a big camp
to the solitary figure high in the air, but
numbers meant nothing, only&mdash;well, his ammunition
would give out sooner or later. Then,
of course, would come capture&mdash;but he wouldn’t
look that far ahead.</p>

<p>During the afternoon several men approached,
one of them displaying a white handkerchief,
which he waved to and fro. When the men
reached the bottom of the hill they dismounted
and one made his way slowly up, shouting now
and again, “It’s me, Jim&mdash;Joe Ludlow.” Cutler
made his way down the path and, suddenly
coming upon Ludlow, ordered him to throw up
his hands. The man did so, saying, “Jim, you
and I have been friends for fifteen years; believe
me, I’m unarmed; I want to talk to you&mdash;trust
me.” Thereupon Cutler lowered his rifle, and
the two men shook hands. Then followed a
long confab, during which Ludlow did his
utmost to get Cutler to surrender. He said
Sheriff Benson was prepared to starve Cutler
out, or get him at all costs. It would only
mean loss of life and must eventually result in
the fugitive’s capture. Ludlow said that he, with
half-a-dozen “pals,” would assure Cutler a safe
return to Three Corners, sending Benson and
all the rest on ahead. Then Cutler could stand
his trial, and, with a good lawyer from Butte to
defend him, would no doubt stand a chance of
some sort.</p>

<p>Cutler listened patiently; then he shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I know what’s coming to me, Joe,” he said;
“they have been after me for years in a quiet
way. Now they want my life, but they sha’n’t
have it&mdash;at least not until I’ve paved the way
with a few of them.”</p>

<p>Ludlow was a very decent sort of fellow, and
he tried his utmost to convince Cutler that his
argument was a good one. Cutler then took
the man into his confidence, and, Ludlow
promising not to say a word to those below, he
was told the whole story&mdash;told of Miss Thurloe’s
complaints, the episode at the school-house, the
shooting of Cutler’s horse, and everything.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m jiggered!” cried Ludlow, when
the tale was finished. “Why didn’t you let us
know this in the first place?” He then informed
the gambler that he would ride back to
Three Corners and explain the situation to the
schoolmistress. She had only to tell her story
to the judge, he said, and it was a certainty he
would interfere in some way. Cutler demurred,
but Ludlow bluntly told him to “go to h&mdash;&mdash;;
he wasn’t going to see a good man hounded to
death.” With that, turning on his heel, he left
without another word.</p>

<p>Going back to the camp, Ludlow informed
Sheriff Benson that under no circumstances
ought he to attempt to take Cutler, and asked
him to await his return from Three Corners.
Benson replied, “I want none of your conversation,
Ludlow; Cutler is a downright murderer,
and I mean to have him.”</p>

<p>Ludlow, disdaining further argument, rode off
at full speed toward the little town where all the
trouble had occurred.</p>

<p>Not knowing just what card Ludlow had up
his sleeve, the sheriff decided to make quick
work of Cutler’s capture. He therefore sent a
party of deputies to Malvern, the nearest telegraph
station, and in the name of the law asked
the county militia to send him some men with
a mountain gun, the property of private
individuals who practised soldiering as a pastime.
Each State in America, it may be said in
passing, possesses several such regiments, which
are available in war-time, although in no way
a part of the Government organization, and
having no connection with the State militia. It
would have been useless to attempt to dislodge
Cutler as matters stood, but Benson believed
that a few shots from a cannon might have the
desired effect. When his message was received
at Malvern it created a sensation. Business was
for the nonce neglected and everybody&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;made their way toward
the sheriffs camp at Table Hill.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made to parley with
Cutler, without success, and so three days went
by. On the afternoon of the fourth day the
refugee on the rock was thunderstruck to see a
body of soldiers approaching from the south,
with a field gun hauled by four horses. He did
not know whether to laugh or to regard this
seriously. Surely the officers of the law would
not resort to bombarding him with a cannon?
Soon the soldiers reached the camp, and about
an hour later Cutler saw that the gun, a howitzer,
was being trained on the hill where he lay
enjoying a smoke. There was no chance of his
getting away other than by the path by which he
had come. Behind him there was a sheer drop
of hundreds of feet into the gully far below.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
True, he could descend some distance down the
mountain-side, but if the besiegers really meant
business this would not help him much.
Nothing was done that day, but Cutler kept
vigilant watch all through the night. He had
regularly built a huge fire some way down the
mountain-side, which was protected by trees to
some extent, but
lit up the path
for a considerable
distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">“IF YOU SO MUCH AS WINK YOUR EYE I’LL PUT A HOLE IN YOU.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next
morning a party
numbering a
dozen came toward
the hill
again bearing a
white flag. They
stopped some
distance off, one
man only continuing&mdash;Benson,
the Sheriff of
Beulah County,
himself. Cutler
allowed him to
approach much
nearer than had
Ludlow; then
he covered the
advancing sheriff
with his rifle.</p>

<p>“Cutler, if we
haven’t rushed
this place,” said
Benson, “it is
only because I
did not want to
sacrifice human
lives, knowing
full well that
sooner or later
you must give
up. I know you
are on the
square, so I’ve
come up unarmed,
being
sure you wouldn’t
take advantage of
the white flag. I’m only doing my duty. I give
you this chance to come back with me, otherwise
I’m afraid they’ll blow this place up and
you with it.”</p>

<p>“Regular war, isn’t it?” replied Cutler,
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” admitted the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Well, seeing you are trying that game, I’ll
just do a little in the war line myself,” said
Cutler. “You walk up this path towards me,
and if you so much as wink your eye I’ll put a
hole in you that a tramcar could go through!”</p>

<p>The sheriff could hardly believe his ears.
“Don’t be a fool, Cutler,” he said, angrily.</p>

<p>“Never mind about my being a fool; you
do as you’re told or I’ll drop you quick.”</p>

<p>Benson evidently
had no
doubts about
the matter, for,
though beside
himself with
rage, he promptly
did as Cutler
ordered. The
sheriff was forced
to walk ahead,
and no doubt,
had his captor
been almost any
other man than
Jim Cutler, there
would have been
one big fight on
Table Hill, gun
or no gun, but
Benson knew
that Cutler would
do just as he
said he would.
Arrived at the
top, Benson was
forced to write a
note saying that
he was a captive,
and that perhaps
it would be just
as well not to fire
the cannon in
the direction it
was now trained.
Furthermore, one
man was to
approach the
hill with food,
whisky, and tobacco.
The note
was then secured
to a large stone by
the aid of Sheriff Benson’s braces, and while
Cutler “stood by” Benson was ordered to throw
this stone toward the deputy in charge of the waiting
horsemen below. This man, or one of those
with him, picked up the stone, and read the
message to the others. There was a great laugh
below&mdash;plainly heard by the two men on the
ledge&mdash;and, needless to say, the merriment of
his assistants did not add to Benson’s peace of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
mind. Cutler now laid his rifle down, first
having drawn a six-shooter. Then, approaching
Benson, he searched him for concealed firearms,
but the sheriff was unarmed. The latter
was now told to sit down and make himself
comfortable at the opening which led to the
path, Cutler being thereby able to watch
both his prisoner and the approach from
below. Soon a solitary figure came from
the camp, carrying the food “ordered.” It
was brought as near as Cutler permitted it to
be, and then Benson, under cover of the rifle,
was sent to fetch it. It looked for a moment as
though there might be a fight after all, but
Cutler’s business-like demeanour soon caused
his prisoner to change his mind.</p>

<p>With the food there was a note, reading,
“Are we to wait for you or not?” This did
not appeal to the sheriff’s sense of humour, and
he tore the paper into shreds.</p>

<p>Just at sundown a large cloud of dust was
noticed in the distance, which soon turned out
to be a number of mounted men with a wagon,
or “prairie schooner.” The new-comers were
presently merged with those in camp, and not
long afterwards two men, escorting a woman,
rode slowly toward Table Hill. Again the
white flag was raised, and a voice shouted from
below, “Hi, Jim, it’s me&mdash;Ludlow.”</p>

<p>Cutler permitted his friend to approach, and
when he gained the ledge Ludlow had a hard
struggle to restrain his laughter at the unfortunate
sheriff’s predicament.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought some news for you, Jim,” said
Ludlow. “That school-ma’am is a brick, and
no mistake. When I told her how things stood,
she came right to the front, and not only saw
Judge Nolan, but drove twenty miles to see
Governor Hill, and here’s the result.”</p>

<p>Ludlow then handed Sheriff Benson an
official communication paroling Cutler in his
own recognizances pending investigation of
Miss Thurloe’s story. Western men are
nothing if not intensely chivalrous, and, if this
girl’s story was correct, Cutler, in their estimation,
deserved, not death, but a medal.</p>

<p>The amazed sheriff scratched his head and
Cutler seemed undecided, but Ludlow grasped
his hand eagerly. “Come on, old fellow, down
to the sea-level,” he cried. This broke the
tension, and all three men smiled.</p>

<p>“There is nothing for me to do but obey
this, Cutler,” said the sheriff, slowly; “but I’ll
tell you straight I don’t feel like doing it.”</p>

<p>Ludlow turned to Benson and informed him
that Judge Nolan had made him a Court officer,
the tenure of his office being thirty days, and
that he would brook no interference from
Benson or anyone else. That settled it. The
trio walked down the path, where Miss Thurloe,
with tears in her eyes, thanked Cutler for his
brave and manly action on her behalf. She
said that she had reason to believe he would be
acquitted, and that, as no warrant had been
issued for his arrest until after he had shot the
men who had attempted to stop him, it must be
a case of self-defence.</p>

<p>Cutler was received with cheers by the crowd
in camp&mdash;the same men who were thirsting for
his blood an hour before&mdash;and soon everybody
was seeking the nearest way home, and the
scene of action was shortly deserted. It is not
possible to chronicle that Jim Cutler was
triumphantly acquitted at his trial. His
character went strongly against him&mdash;that is to
say, the fact that he had previously figured in
“shooting scrapes”&mdash;but, nevertheless, his
sentence was a comparatively light one. The
State’s attorney (analogous to counsel for the
Crown) laid great stress on the fact of
Cutler’s having visited Goldman’s shop,
obviously seeking trouble, when he should have
reported the attempt on his life to the authorities.
He was sentenced to five years in the State
prison, but was pardoned at the expiration of
eleven months. He is now living in Butte, the
capital of the State of Montana, where he has
opened a saloon. Miss Thurloe left Three
Corners, and is believed to be teaching in
Pittsburg, U.S.A.</p>

<p>The local newspapers poked much fun at the
soldiers who took their cannon miles out to
bombard what they jocularly called “a one-man
army”; but all the same they meant business, and
had matters not ended as they did there would
have been a change in the landscape just there,
for the top of Table Hill would in all probability
have been blown to pieces, and Jim Cutler with it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> Tuesday, July 1, 1899, reports
reached Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands,
that the volcano of Makuaweoweo,
situated at the summit of Mauna
Loa, thirteen thousand six hundred
and seventy-five feet high, on the island of
Hawaii, had burst forth with all the fury of
years gone by. I was anxious to get some
photographs of the eruption if possible, and so
made all the haste I could to get my paraphernalia
together and catch the steamer <i>W. H.

<p>I left with the intention of reaching the scene
of action from the Kau side of the island, but
when, upon arriving at Kailua, Kona, I telegraphed
to Mr. N. S. Monsarrat, at Kapapalu,
I found that he had a house full of guests bent
on the same journey, and that all his horses had
been engaged. Rather than lose time, therefore,
I decided to take the most difficult route
of all&mdash;right over the great mountain from the
Kona side. The obstacles to be overcome may
perhaps be imagined when I state that Mauna
Loa is a volcanic mountain, nearly fourteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
thousand feet high, and that one has to make
one’s way for the entire distance over every kind
of lava formation.</p>

</div>

<p>It was with great difficulty that I managed to
get horses and mules from the natives, who knew
the condition of the country, for the animals
inevitably get badly knocked about, their legs
being terribly cut by the lava, which is divided
into two classes&mdash;“Pahoehoe” and “A. A.”
The former term is applied to tracts of comparatively
smooth lava, which appears as though
it had cooled while flowing quietly; the latter is
applied to stretches of broken lava which seem to
have cooled when tossing like an ocean in a bad
storm, and to have afterwards been broken up
by earthquakes. No words of description can
convey an idea of its roughness and hardness,
which may be faintly realized from an inspection
of the above photograph.</p>

<p>During the time I was hunting for horses a
number of gentlemen arrived and expressed
their desire to join me in the expedition. I was
only too pleased to have their company, so five
travellers threw in their lot with me: Professor
Ingalls, Colonel McCarthy, and Messrs. Sterns
Buck, J. Ballard, and H. C. Klugel. These,
with three guides, completed our party.</p>

<p>We were up early the next morning. The
first part of the journey was one of the most
delightful rides I ever had. We rode for hours
through magnificent tropical growths. There
were giant ferns, some of which must have been
thirty or forty feet high and three feet in
diameter, groves of guavas, coco-nuts, and other
fruits, miles of wild mint and bright-coloured
flowers, and orchids of most delicate shapes.</p>

<p>At dusk we reached the edge of the timber-line,
in a drenching rain, a downpour such as is
experienced only in the tropics, where the rain
descends in sheets. We ate our supper and
then spent the night huddled miserably together,
trying in vain to keep dry.</p>

<p>We resumed our journey at daybreak, over the
most terrible country that can be imagined. The
sharp edges of the lava cut through our stout
boots like broken glass, and the poor animals
suffered greatly. Still, however, we persevered,
and finally reached the summit just as it was
getting dark. Near the centre of the mountain-top
an area of about four square miles sinks to
a depth of one thousand feet. This is the great
crater of Makuaweoweo, which we had endured
so much to see.</p>

<p>As I stood there in the cold, in the midst of
those cheerless and God-forsaken wastes, I gazed
down with speechless awe upon the untrammelled
frolics of the God of Fire. The tempest-tossed
lake of molten lava below the rim of the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
cauldron was a typical workshop of Vulcan.
The face of the lake of liquid fire alternated
continually between black and white, like molten
iron in a furnace. Oxidation and cooling of the
fiery fluid would blacken the surface with a
pall that covered it in darkest gloom; then
a trembling, caused by further subterranean
outbursts of steam, would break this ice-like
oxide into a fretwork of tens of thousands of
incandescent cracks, lighting up the smoke-charged
pit with a fierce glare. Another
moment, and in different parts of the lake
geysers of fire of every imaginable colour would
rise like fountains in a public garden.</p>

</div>

<p>The great forbidding-looking walls of this
“home of everlasting fire” sparkled with the
unusual light, and then, as the spouts of flame
died away, the surface would again turn black,
leaving the whole mass to all appearances dead.</p>

<p>We found that the worst outbreak was about
five thousand feet farther down the mountain-side.
Some of our party were seized with such
a sickness of horror at the crater’s edge that
they rolled themselves up in their blankets and
refused to look down upon this fiery maelstrom&mdash;and
that after two days of arduous
effort to reach a point of view!</p>

<p>When the time came for sleep, another man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
and I turned into a “blowhole” in the lava; it
was an immense bubble that had cooled and
left an opening so that we could crawl in. We
little thought that there was another hole at the
other end, and the piercing wind blew through
this like a funnel; but we had to stay there, for
it is dangerous to wander about over the rifts
and chasms of jagged lava in the darkness.
Here, in this strange bed-chamber, we slept, or
tried to sleep&mdash;shivering and shuddering through
the chilly solitude of the night in those desolate
mountain wastes.</p>

<p>Walking across the congealed masses of lava
next morning, one began to think that at any
moment one was liable to drop through to the
very gates of Hades and be precipitated to the
most horrible of deaths. Underneath one was
a bottomless abyss of mud, sulphur, and rock;
and to contemplate being cast into that fearsome-looking
lake of fire and brimstone was not
at all comfortable. The Biblical description of
hell does not convey even a faint idea of that
terrible lake of fire below us, which appeared to
be fretting and fuming as though anxious to get
loose and destroy everything in its path. The
crater of Makuaweoweo at that time, without
doubt, afforded the spectator a more awe-inspiring
display of the forces of Nature than
has been granted to man elsewhere on earth
without the sacrifice of life.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight we prepared for the
descent to the point that was throwing out
molten lava at a white heat. It was practically
impossible to take the horses farther, so we
tethered them to stones near the yawning depths
of Makuaweoweo, and left one of the guides to
look after them. We were very thirsty, but it was
some time before we could find water, though
snow and ice were plentiful. Farther down,
however, we discovered water in a deep crack
in the lava, filled the canteens, and started on
our downward journey. I was suffering from
mountain sickness; my head felt as if it would
burst and my stomach was upside down. We
stumbled along with difficulty for about two
miles, when I had to get the assistance of Mr.
Buck to carry my camera. Two of our party
who had started out in advance gave it up and
returned&mdash;they could not stand the strain of the
rough travelling. This left but four of us, with
two guides.</p>

<p>Presently we reached a cone where the lava
had piled up to the height of about one hundred
feet, then, bursting out at the side, disappeared
into the ground, to reappear about a quarter of
a mile farther down and repeat its action. These
cones averaged two hundred feet in width at the
base and one hundred feet in height, and we
passed five “dead” ones. A sixth was still
smoking, but was not active. Two of the party
tried to climb to the top of this cone, but were
unable to do so.</p>

<p>We then pushed on to cone number seven,
which was belching forth huge volumes of steam
and sulphur. The fumes, most fortunately,
were being blown away from us. At this stage
one of the guides refused to go any farther; it
was too dangerous, he said, so he proceeded to
retrace his steps, while we others continued our
journey toward cone number eight. This was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
the last and largest, and was, I should estimate,
about two hundred feet high; in fact, a veritable
miniature volcano, spouting red-hot lava a
hundred feet in the air with a ripping boom that
could be heard for miles. Boulders that must
have weighed a ton were being hurled high into
the air as if shot from a cannon. Others followed
to meet those coming down, and as they met
they burst like explosive shells, scattering molten
matter on all sides. This flowed down the
incline in cascades like water, showing red,
yellow, blue, and all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the grandeur of
the effect, and a knowledge of the force that
was causing the display made one feel very
small indeed. Some of the ejected masses were
as large as a horse, and when they were belched
forth were at a white heat. They went so high
that they had time to cool and return to the
vortex black.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the afternoon when we
reached this wonderful display. It had taken
us nine hours to reach the volcano, and we were
thirsty and well-nigh exhausted. We could not
approach very near on account of the heat, but
I made some photographic exposures, and then
sat for an hour watching the wonderful sight.
As the sun went down the magnificence of the
scene increased. The ground shook at each
explosion to such an extent as to make us sick.
We found quantities of what is known as “Pele’s
hair.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It is caused by the wind blowing the
liquid lava through the air, forming fine threads
like human hair.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
Pele, according to the native legends, is the goddess of the
volcano, and dwells in the crater.</p></div>

<p>As we approached cone number seven on our
return journey the wind changed, and to our
consternation we saw a cloud of sulphur blowing
right across our path. These masses of vapour
are so impregnated with sulphur and poisonous
gases that it is impossible for any living thing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
exist among them, and to get caught in their
midst means death. Alarmed, we started to go
around the other side, but found the lava was
too hot; the surface was cool, but there was
living fire beneath, and we dared not proceed.
We kept on until the lava began to move under
our feet, and then beat a retreat to face the
sulphur again, for it was better to be smothered
to death than slowly roasted.</p>

<p class="caption">CONE “NUMBER SEVEN”&mdash;IT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH, A MINIATURE VOLCANO, SPOUTING RED-HOT LAVA AND GIANT BOULDERS WITH A ROAR THAT COULD
BE HEARD FOR MILES.<br />
<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We made a number of attempts to pass that
deadly barrier of vapour, but were forced to
return each time, nearly suffocated. It looked
as though we should soon be choked to death&mdash;the
fire at the back of us, the sulphur in front.
Professor Ingalls remarked that we had better
make the best of our time by taking notes, and
then prepare for the worst. Just at this critical
moment I happened to turn round and saw an
arch, as it were, in the sulphur smoke, where the
wind was blowing it up from the ground.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” I shouted, in great excitement.
“Run for it!” And how we ran!
Providence gave us the chance and fear lent us
strength, for under ordinary circumstances we
could never have run as we did, owing to the
condition of our feet. The danger, however,
made us forget the pain, and we ran for dear life.
We had scarcely got through that arch of clear
air when down came the cloud again, as though
lowered by some great power. The only guide
who had stayed with us fell exhausted at the
edge of the vapour-mass. How I managed to
drag him along I do not know; I hardly realized
what I was doing, but I managed to save him.</p>

<p>Once past the danger-point we crawled along
at our best pace, for at any moment the wind
might turn in our direction, when we should be
again overtaken by that terrible death-cloud. I
had left my camera behind in our wild flight,
but fortunately I saved several plates.</p>

<p>It was now night, and the only light we had
was the lurid glare from the volcano. Suddenly,
as we stumbled painfully along, we came upon a
man sitting by the side of a dead cone; it was
the guide who had returned. He said he did
not expect to see us alive again, for he had seen
the deadly smoke blow across the mountain.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the light from the
volcano we should undoubtedly have perished of
cold and thirst, as we should have been compelled
to stop walking. As it was, we dared not
halt for any length of time, or we should not
have had warmth enough to keep the blood
circulating. All that night we crawled over
that terrible lava. We fell down at intervals of
about twenty feet, often breaking through the
black crust, sometimes up to our waists, cutting
ourselves on the sharp projections until our
hands and legs were woefully lacerated. Almost
as soon as we fell we dropped asleep; then, as
we got colder, we would wake up and force ourselves
on again for a few dozen yards or so, only
to fall asleep, wake, and struggle up once more.
The agony of the situation and the pain of our
wounds were enough to make a man go insane.</p>

<p>At last it began to get light, but still we had
come across no water, and that in our canteens
had long since been exhausted. Very few
people, fortunately, know what it means to have
their throats and lips so swollen and cracked that
they are bleeding for want of water. I could
scarcely speak. We hunted the depths and
crevices of the lava, sometimes going down ten
or fifteen feet, looking for water, only to be
disappointed again and again. At last I got so
weak that Mr. Buck had to take my package of
plates off my back, where I had tied them.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a break in the lava nearly full
of beautiful water. I pulled Mr. Buck’s arm,
pointing to it, and mumbled, “Water.” Slowly
he pulled off his coat and started to climb down
the crack. It was about eight feet wide, narrowing
to three. I leaned over the side, holding
the canteen for Mr. Buck to fill. He went
down a few feet, and then stopped. I
motioned to him to fill the bottle, croaking,
“Water.” He did not look around, but mumbled,
“I see no water,” as if in a dream. Picking up
a piece of lava, I tossed it down and cried
hoarsely, “<i>There</i> is the water.” But to my
astonishment the pebble went down, down,
down, out of sight, with no sound of a splash,
into a fathomless abyss. The crevice was so
deep that we could not see the bottom, and the
shock of the discovery made me faint. How
Sterns Buck managed to return he does not
remember; it is a wonder he did not fall, to be
mangled upon the sharp corners of lava.</p>

<p>I came to my senses dazed and almost
bewildered, and Buck and I sat motionless for
some time staring at each other. After a time
we scrambled on again until we came upon the
guide sitting upon the edge of a high crack,
eating frozen snow, and tearing at it with his
teeth like a hungry dog. We followed his
example, not without pain, but the snow tasted
good.</p>

<p>Some of the party who had previously returned
met us near the summit with coffee. When
they saw us coming they got things ready so as
to make us as comfortable as possible. After
washing our lacerated hands and feet we took a
good sleep, and awoke much refreshed. The
journey home was, comparatively speaking, easy,
but the memory of that night amidst the lava
will last me to my dying day.

<p>An exciting story told by a former official of the Gold Coast Government. With a friend and some

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> 1899, while in the service of
the Gold Coast Government, and
stationed at Kumasi, I received
orders “per bearer, who will accompany
you,” to proceed to a point on
Volta not far south of where it
debouches from among the Saraga Hills.
“The bearer,” a nice young fellow called
Strange, was newly arrived in the colony, and
his pleasant home gossip was not less welcome
to me than my information about the country
we were in was to him. Our rough forest
journey, then, passed as pleasantly as such
journeys can, and by the time we arrived at our
destination we were the best of friends.</p>

<p>Akroful, a town of about seven hundred
inhabitants, was the nearest place of any size to
the spot where we pitched our camp, and we
were soon on good terms with its headman,
Otibu Daku, and his son, Dansani, both of
whom put us in the way of some good shooting.</p>

<p>We had been in this place about a fortnight,
when we began to be annoyed by the depredations
of a marauding leopard, who took to
visiting our live-stock pens, and at last we
decided to lie in wait for him. I took the first
watch until a snake crawled over my legs; then
I went to bed. It was a harmless one, but it
reminded me of the need of precaution, so next
night found our lair surrounded by a very
uninviting floor of cactus leaves.</p>

<p>The fourth night after our vigil commenced
Strange succeeded in wounding our sell-invited
guest, and we determined to track him down as
soon as it was light. Otibu Daku and his son
willingly agreed to help us; and I took, in
addition, two of my own men who would, I
knew, “stand fire”&mdash;Ashong Tawiah, an Accra
man, and Nyato, my chief steward-boy, a
Krooman.</p>

<p>The two Ashantis led the way, Otibu Daku
carrying a “long Dane” gun; his son, a
machete. Tawiah and Nyato also carried
machetes, and the former, on leaving camp, had
picked up a broad-bladed Hausa spear. Strange
and I each had a repeating rifle and a revolver,
for, as Nyato told me, “Dem headman, ’e say,
plenty tiger lib dem part.”</p>

<p>The trail was easy to follow. There was not
much blood, but the ground was soft from
recent rain. It was rough going, however, and
the machetes were constantly at work clearing
a way. Up and down small watersheds,
squelching through marshy bottoms, crossing
streams on fallen trees, we frequently lost the
track, but by some sort of instinct our guides
always found it again.</p>

<p>At last, after descending a more than usually
steep incline, we found ourselves in a valley of
some size. The bush here was very thin, and
we progressed without difficulty until we came
in sight of the inevitable stream, the opposite
bank of which, rising steeply, evidently formed
the commencement of the next divide. I was
about a dozen yards to Strange’s right; the
ground was clear of bush between us and the
stream; and on the nearer bank, his head overhanging
the water, lay our quarry, clearly dying.
But he was not alone. Stretched by his side,
licking the wound that was letting out his life,
lay a fine female leopard, evidently his consort.
On seeing us she rose to her feet, snarling;
she abandoned her ministrations and became
militant&mdash;a defender-avenger. Strange fired
hastily on sight, and a convulsive heave of the
prostrate body showed where the bullet struck.
With a light leap the leopardess cleared her
mate, and with long, low springs raced down
towards my friend. He fired again at thirty
yards, wounding her, and she swerved slightly
and came in my direction. We both fired
together, whereupon she stopped suddenly,
reared straight up, pawing the air&mdash;then fell
backward, stone-dead.

<p class="caption">“SHE REARED STRAIGHT UP PAWING THE AIR&mdash;THEN FELL BACKWARD, STONE-DEAD.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hardly had the double report died away
when our attention was attracted to a movement
on the other side of the stream. Tawiah
pointed.</p>

<p>“Oolah! tiger him piccin!” (“Master, the
leopard’s cubs”), he cried. Slinking away downstream,
with long, stealthy strides, their muzzles
to the ground and tails trailing low, were two
half-grown leopards, the head of one level with
the other’s haunch.</p>

<p>“Tally-ho!” cried Strange, and let fly at
them. His one fault as a sportsman was a
too great eagerness to get the first shot in.
The white splinters flew from the buttress of a
great cotton-wood, and the nearer cub, startled
as never before, leapt a man’s height from the
ground, and, coming down, raced away downstream
after its companion.</p>

<p>“Come on! We’ll bag the whole family,”
said Strange, jumping into the stream. Otibu
Daku was already across and I was about to
follow, when I noticed, fluttering up the farther
slope, one of those beautiful insects called the
“dead leaf” butterfly. You will see one fluttering
along like a fugitive piece of rainbow&mdash;then
suddenly it will alight on a withered branch or
heap of dead herbage and disappear, the underside
of the wings being in shape, colour, and
even veining an exact imitation of a withered
leaf.</p>

<p>I was an enthusiastic collector, and never
went out without a folding net that could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
fixed to any fairly straight stick. Bidding
Tawiah remain with me, then, I let the others
go on after the cubs, and in a couple of minutes
was in pursuit of my own particular quarry.
The slope was nearly bare of bush, and I did
not have much difficulty in making the capture.
Placing it in a flat box containing some poison-wax,
I took my rifle from Tawiah and went on up
the hill, leaving him tying up a scratch on his leg.</p>

<p>I was not quite easy in my mind. We had
been too hasty in concluding that the cubs we
had seen belonged to the leopards we had shot.
They had been driven away too easily, and most
likely were heading straight for their own den,
where, at that time of day, the old ones would
certainly be at home.</p>

<p>I hurried on in the hope of getting some
indication of my friend’s whereabouts. At the
top of the ascent a soft breeze met me, it was
pleasant and refreshing, but it brought that with
it that made me drop flat behind a bush and
throw my rifle forward. There is no mistaking
the odour given off by the larger carnivora, and
the strength of the smell that assailed my
nostrils was such as to convince me that my
first hasty thought&mdash;that I had headed off the
cubs&mdash;was wrong. Such an effluvium could come
only from a den, and an occupied one at that.</p>

<p>There were three possibilities. It might be
the home of the dead leopards, of the strange
cubs we had seen, or the lair of yet a third
family. I looked back. Tawiah was not in
sight, but I knew he would follow. In front, for
a hundred yards, the level crest of the ridge
was covered by a sparse, wand-like growth that
was no impediment to the view. Beyond the
ground fell away again, and just on the edge,
and rather to my right, stood two enormous
cotton-woods, the space between them being a
labyrinth of roots standing thigh-high from the
ground.</p>

<p>To this point, with what speed and silence I
could command, I made my way. Midway
I stopped abruptly to listen. A deep snarling,
worrying sound filled the air, coming from
straight ahead. Reaching the nearest root, I
looked over. The rapidly falling ground
beyond was hidden by a far-sweeping buttress
from the tree on my left, which, running
parallel with the one I stood against, made
a passage about four feet wide and two high.
Stealing away to the left, where the nearer root
sank below the surface, I entered the passage,
and, on all fours, reached a point midway
between the two trees. The noise I had before
heard was now very distinct, and, blending with
it, yet dominating it, came a continuous buzzing
sound like the far-away roll of a drum. I knew
it for the purring of a full-grown leopard.</p>

<p>Looking back, I was glad enough to see
Tawiah reaching the level. I raised a warning
hand, and, waiting only to see that he observed
me, turned, and very cautiously looked over
the root in front. From where I crouched
the ground fell away very steeply and
was bare and stony. Then began a gentler
slope covered with a low scrub and running
down into a valley similar to, but larger than,
the one we had just left. Down the centre
flowed a stream, the same on whose banks,
higher up, we had left the dead leopards. I
was on a kind of spur, round which the stream
made a bend away to my right. To my left it
lost itself in an expanse of shallow water covered
with great water-lilies, which merged in its turn
into the stream of the Volta, half a mile away.</p>

<p>Just where the change of slope began was a
great outcrop of rock. About a foot above the
base, and facing me, was a ragged opening, and
in this, with both paws hanging over the edge,
lounged a fine she-leopard. The air hummed
with her complacent purr, as, with blinking
eyes, she watched the rough play of two well-grown
cubs. Presently she rolled over on her
back, and, with downward-hanging head, struck
idly with a mighty paw at a white butterfly
flitting above her. She was the personification
of soft and sinuous strength.</p>

<p>Suddenly, away to the right, a shot rang out.
The purring ceased, and instantly the great cat
was couched, rigid as a bronze casting. Except
for the tip of her tail, not a muscle moved.
Presently the tense expression relaxed, and
with a guttural sort of sigh her head dropped
on to her paws. But only for an instant.
The stealthy rustling of something approaching
reached her ears, and she resumed
her alert attitude. Then her eyes half closed
again, and she seemed to go smooth all over.
A suave, fawning expression came into her face;
her purring redoubled; she rolled softly on to
her side and gazed intently in the direction of
the sound. The noise came nearer, and
presently, as I expected, her mate appeared.
He paused for an instant to look back, and
at that moment Strange’s rifle spoke again, and
the leopard sank down, biting savagely at his
hind-quarters. With one movement as it
seemed, and with a sort of deep-throated cough,
his consort was by his side, and then began an
awful duet of snarls and growls, rumblings and
snufflings, with the cubs for chorus.</p>

<p>It was high time for me to take action; a
wounded leopard and a leopardess with young
can make themselves pretty awkward. I aimed
at the female as being the more dangerous, and
was about to pull the trigger, when a movement
in the valley attracted my attention. One of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the cubs we had first seen was tearing across the
open, making for the stream. Some distance
behind followed the other, evidently wounded.
Close upon him ran Dansani, machete in hand.
As I looked the cub turned and Dansani struck.
Nyato was close behind, and level with him,
but farther out, Otibu Daku stole swiftly with
long, bent-kneed strides, his “long Dane” gun
held across his body. Strange was not in sight.</p>

<p>The foremost cub was nearly at the stream
when he raised a howl of fear or of warning, I
do not know which. On the instant, from a
clump of bushes on the farther side, there leapt
two greyish-white forms. Clearing the stream, they
charged straight down on the young Ashanti.</p>

<p>All this was photographed on my brain while
my finger was on the trigger. The scene was
blotted out as I fired, and from that moment I
had enough on my hands to occupy my
undivided attention. The leopardess was
killed outright. The next instant I fired at
the male, but one of the cubs gave a jump
and received the bullet meant for his sire.
How the brute did it I do not know&mdash;for he
had a broken thigh-bone&mdash;but next moment the
old leopard was tearing up the slope towards me,
and very business-like he looked. I fired again
and clipped his ear; then his claws were hooked
on to the root in front of me, and all I could
do was to smash the butt, pile-driver fashion,
down upon his head. He seized it in his jaws,
and the hard wood cracked like pitch-pine,
while the wrench nearly tore the weapon from
my grasp. He gave me no time to reverse
it for another shot, or to draw my revolver.
Four times did he struggle to draw himself up,
and but for his broken leg I could not have
prevented him. Four times, luckily for me, he
allowed his fury to vent itself on the rifle-butt.
The struggle only lasted seconds, but it seemed
hours, and already the fury of it made my
breath come short.</p>

<p>And then the cub decided to take a hand!
It had been pacing to and fro, snuffing the
blood and growling; it then suddenly turned,
and dashed straight to the scene of combat. A
leopard cub by itself is not more than a man
can manage, but as a reinforcement to an
infuriated parent it is a serious matter. I heard
Tawiah behind me.</p>

<p>“Take the piccin,” I yelled, and put all my
strength into an effort to thrust my foe back.
Instinctively he tried to use his injured leg, and
this time he lost grip altogether, and his claws
scraped down the root, making great furrows
in the wood. I let him have the gun, and
seized my revolver in time to plant a couple of
bullets in his head as he came up again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tawiah had accounted for the
cub, but he was badly clawed down the leg.
To my surprise&mdash;for I did not remember the
brute using his claws at all except to hold on by&mdash;my
coat was ripped, and I had several nasty,
but not severe, scratches down chest and arms.</p>

<p>Our attention was now diverted to the scene
below, and what we saw sent us both down the
slope as fast as we could race&mdash;Tawiah ahead.
One cub lay dead&mdash;Dansani’s victim&mdash;and a few
paces from it stood the young Ashanti, preparing
to dodge the foremost of the parent
leopards I had seen break cover. He sprang
aside as it reached him, but the brute wheeled
as if on a pivot and reared. Then came the
crashing report of the “long Dane,” a fearful
yell, and Dansani reeled away with his hands
to his head, and fell. The leopard, roaring
horribly, rolled over and over, apparently broken
in two. Its mate, swerving at the report,
turned and raced straight for Tawiah, who had
just reached the level ground. I shouted
to him to come back to me, thinking that
revolver and spear together would match the
furious brute, but apparently he did not understand,
for, waving me to follow, he tore off to
where, midway between him and the advancing
leopard, stood a small Dequa palm. His
object, I learnt afterwards, was to hold the
leopard at bay there till help arrived. It was a
mad idea, for the savage brute was covering
three yards to one of his.</p>

<p>Just at that moment I caught sight of Strange&mdash;hobbling
along, supported by his rifle, five
hundred yards away; there was no help to be
expected from him. Nyato was rushing on to
settle with the remaining cub, that, screaming,
was alternately dashing towards its wounded
dam and back to the stream. Otibu Daku was
carrying Dansani to the water, and the female
leopard, her hind quarters straddling like those
of a frog, with the small of her back blown away
and reared on her front legs, was rending the
air with the most awful yells.</p>

<p>The male passed the tree, and only about
forty yards separated him from my faithful
follower. I ran on. Trusting to luck, I fired
two chambers, but without success. The distance
between them decreased rapidly, and
Tawiah, seeing the hopelessness of his position,
grounded his spear, and, gripping it by the
middle, backed up the butt with his knee in the
hope that the brute would impale himself. Then
I saw that Strange was kneeling, taking aim.
He could never hit a running leopard at that
range, I told myself; it would appear no bigger
than a cat to him.</p>

<p>I was twenty yards behind Tawiah, and barely
ten separated him from the leopard, when a
ball of smoke floated away from Strange’s rifle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
I dared not hope, and Tawiah remained like a
rock. Then, suddenly, the leopard halted, and&mdash;for
all the world like a kitten chasing its own
tail&mdash;spun round and round till we could hardly
tell one end from the other. I sent two bullets
as near the centre as I could, and Tawiah,
charging in, drove his spear in at one side and
out at the other. The battle was over.</p>

<p class="caption">“DANSANI REELED AWAY WITH HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD, AND FELL.”</p>
</div>

<p>We found that Strange’s bullet had pierced
the skin of the neck just where it joins the head,
and had half stunned the animal. But what a
glorious shot! I paced the distance to him; it
was four hundred and sixty odd yards! He had
made just a little too much allowance for speed,
but what of that?</p>

<p>Strange, it appeared, had stepped on a loose
stone and strained his ankle badly. Poor
Dansani was horribly mauled. The beast had
clawed him from the crown of his head to the
knee in one awful sweep. Half the scalp overhung
his face, one eye was destroyed, the
muscle of the upper arm was in ribbons, and
the stroke, glancing from the elbow, had laid
open his thigh to the knee. A revolver-shot
finished his assailant. We did what we could
for Dansani on the spot, and Nyato and his father
carried him home on a hastily-constructed litter.
Later he recovered, but was terribly disfigured.</p>

<p>Tawiah and I took it in turns to help Strange
along, and when we reached the spot where our
first victims lay we found their young ones
mewling over them. They slunk away, and we
did not molest them. The cub Nyato had
chased allowed self-preservation to triumph over
filial affection, and got away also. My rifle was
utterly ruined. And so ended our leopard hunt.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">That</span> strange creature, the turtle, is
now receiving the attention of the
farmer, and is being scientifically
bred and reared in various parts of
the world. Indeed, turtle-farming
on a large scale is now carried on both in Japan
and in America, while the great palisade enclosures
on the shores in the West Indies,
where turtles are confined until wanted for the
London market, may well come under the same
designation.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the species of turtle
favoured respectively by the Japanese, Americans,
and by English people are totally different.
For instance, the Japanese
farmer gives his attention
to the propagation of the
snapping-turtle and
American to the
diamond-backed
terrapin, while
the turtle soup
so much prized
by the wealthy
and sought after
by the sick in this
country is made
from the green
turtle of the
West Indies.</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUP OF YOUNG TURTLES JUST HATCHED.<br />

</div>

<p>The terrapin
is quite a small
creature, rather
flat-backed and
rounded in outline,
its scales
being marked
by independent
black patterns
composed of many geometric
figures placed one
within another. At one
time it was found in
large quantities in the shallow bays and salt
marshes along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts
to Texas. The discovery that its flesh
made a delicious stew and an ideal soup,
however, resulted in the creature being hunted
so vigorously that to-day it is exceedingly scarce.
Indeed, whereas a terrapin, seven inches in
length, could be picked up a few years ago for a
few cents, it would be difficult to secure one
to-day for a five-pound note. It was this
scarcity of the terrapin, and the big demand for
it among the hotels and restaurants, that have
led not a few enterprising men to establish farms,
where these much-sought-after creatures are
bred and reared for the
market in large numbers.</p>

<p>The terrapin being
small, perfectly harmless,
and requiring
but a little pond
of salt water to
dwell in, there
is nothing particularly
exciting
in farming it.
Indeed, a terrapin
“farm” consists
merely of a
number of small
ponds or basins
in which the
creatures are
confined according
to their age
and size. Thus,
in the smaller
ponds, we discover
those just
hatched from
the eggs&mdash;curious little
things not much bigger
than a billiard ball. As
they breed well, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
not necessary to keep the creature long before
it is ready for the <i>chef</i>, terrapin farming may be
described as a fairly remunerative business.</p>

<p>Decidedly more up-to-date are the snapping-turtle
farms of Mr. Hattori, situated just outside
Tokio, the capital of Japan. The Japanese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
people will proudly tell you that
they are the only turtle farms in
the world, but, as I have already
shown, this is hardly correct.
These farms were established
some few years ago now, and are,
without question, a great success.
On an average, Mr. Hattori supplies
to the hotels and restaurants
of Japan over sixteen thousand
turtles a year, while another five
thousand are shipped to China.
So far as the farm itself is concerned,
it consists of a number of
rectangular ponds, large and
small, the larger ones having an
area of fifteen to twenty thousand
square feet.</p>

ARE KEPT IN A SEPARATE ENCLOSURE
IN ORDER THAT THEIR CANNIBALISTIC ELDERS
MAY NOT DEVOUR THEM.<br />
<i>From a Photo. by M. Ichikawa, Japan.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One or more of the ponds is
always reserved for large breeding
individuals, or “parents,” as they
are called, and one of the assistants
visits this pond twice a day
to look out for new deposits of
eggs. Over these he places a wire
basket, with the date marked
upon it. In one of our photographs
a number of these wire
baskets may be seen, though
unfortunately the eggs are not
shown, being covered with a slight layer of sand,
this work being done by the turtle itself. The
covering serves a twofold purpose&mdash;the obvious
one of marking the place, and, in addition,
that of keeping other females from
digging in the same spot. When
hundreds, or even thousands, of these
baskets are seen along the bank of a
“parents’ pond,” the sight is one to
gladden the heart of an embryologist,
to say nothing of the proprietor.</p>

<p>The hatching of the eggs occupies,
on an average, sixty days. The time,
however, may be considerably shortened
or lengthened, according to
whether the summer is hot and the sun
pours down its strong rays day after
day, or whether there is much rain and
the heat not great. As the turtles lay
sixty eggs to the nest at two sittings, it
will be seen that in a single season many
thousands are added to this unique
establishment, but at least five years must elapse
before they are large enough for the <i>chef</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>
</div>

<p>One would imagine, remembering the quantities
of eggs laid by turtles, that they would be
very plentiful, but there are few creatures that
have more enemies. All that the mother turtle
does is to deposit her eggs on the sand of some
island and there leave them to be hatched out
by the sun. Before this process is accomplished
they are often destroyed by rats and birds,
while very few of those that are hatched survive
very long. The moment the young turtle
emerges from its shell it seeks the water, and
there crabs and various kinds of fish are ever
ready to devour it. The young just hatched at
the farm under notice are put in a pond or
ponds by themselves and given finely-chopped
meat of a fish like the pilchard, while the bigger
ones are fed largely on live eels. This feeding
continues to the end of September. In October
the snapping-turtle ceases to take food, and
finally burrows in the muddy bottom of the
pond to hibernate, coming out only in April or
May.</p>

<p>Snapping-turtle farming is much more exciting
than raising the American terrapin. The former
is a vicious creature and will snap at
anything&mdash;hence its name. Indeed, in disposition
it is the very opposite of its American brother.
It believes most thoroughly in the survival of
the fittest, and to it the fittest is number one.
It is a chronic fighter, and inasmuch as its jaws
are very strong and, like a bulldog, it never knows
when to let go, it is a reptile to be either mastered
or avoided. Indeed, the men at Mr. Hattori’s
farm can tell many exciting little stories concerning
the voracity of this strange creature.
One farm hand, for instance, is minus a finger,
the result of not using sufficient care when
transferring one of the larger reptiles to a new
pond.</p>

<p class="caption">FEEDING THE EELS WHICH IN TURN PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE LARGER TURTLES.<br />
<i>From a Photo. by M. Ichikawa, Japan.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Many naturalists have visited this unique
farm and, after a close study of the turtle and
its habits, have confirmed all the bad qualities
that have been recorded concerning it. In
securing its food it shows that it possesses no
mean intelligence. At one time it crawls slowly
and silently along with neck outstretched towards
an unsuspecting fish, springs upon it by a
powerful thrust of its hind legs, and snaps it up;
at another time it drives the fish around the
basin and terrifies it until it falls an unresisting
victim. Again, the reptile may be observed
buried in the sandy soil of its prison with only
its bill and eyes protruding. On the approach
of a fish the head and long neck dart forth from
the sand with lightning speed and the prey is
caught and instantly killed by a savage bite.</p>

<p>In its wild state the snapping-turtle is distinctly
a nocturnal animal, and does its hunting
after sunset, when it emerges from its muddy
home to look for food. In the presence of
danger it becomes bold, defiant, and even
desperate. When driven to bay it retracts
its neck, head, and widely-gaping jaws into
its shell, awaiting a favourable opportunity
to thrust them forth slyly and bite savagely.
Anything which it has seized in its jaws it
holds with wonderful tenacity, at the same time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
vigorously scratching the earth with its sharp
claws. There is only one way to catch the
snapping-turtle, and that is to secure it by the
tail. Some of the men at Mr. Hattori’s farm
are very dexterous in seizing their victims in
this fashion.</p>

<p>A little time ago a Russian officer visited
the establishment and listened, with some
incredulity, to the stories of the voracity of the
reptiles in the ponds before him. He carried
in his hand a stout cane, and was told to place
it near one of the bigger animals. He did so,
and was surprised to find that in a few minutes
it was bitten clean through. Before now the
snapping-turtle has been known to bite through
the flat of an oar. Not only will this turtle
catch all kinds of fish and frogs and devour
them greedily, but it is not averse to hunting
waterfowl. Mr. Hattori declares that, in addition
to raising turtles, he could rear ducks and geese
as well, but dare not, as the reptiles would only
kill them. When a snapping-turtle detects a
duck it cunningly makes its way towards the
creature, seizes it by its legs, pulls it down under
water, and then drags it to the bottom of the
pond. Here it tears the duck to pieces with
the aid of the long claws of its fore paws and
devours it.</p>

<p>It is this snapping propensity which makes it
desirable to keep the reptiles in ponds according
to their ages; it would not do to put those just
hatched in the same basin as the bigger ones,
as they would quickly be eaten. Until they
reach their sixth year they are never “mixed.”
When they reach this age, however, they are
capable of taking care of themselves and are
allowed access to the bigger ponds. By this
time the turtle has reached maturity and may
begin to deposit eggs, though it is not at its
prime till two or three years later.</p>

AMONG THEM IS VERY HEAVY.<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>What the Japanese epicure prefers are turtles
not more than five years of age, when the flesh
is soft and in desirable condition for the making
of stews and soups. At this age the snapping-turtle
weighs from sixty to eighty pounds.
Those that are destined for the table are kept
in a pond to themselves, and taken as required
in nets or pulled out of the water by their tails.
They are then placed in tin boxes or cases with
air-holes, and sent by train to their destination.</p>

<p>The turtle that is consumed in this country is
the green species, from the West Indies. The
creatures are imported by Mr. T. K. Bellis, who
will not hesitate to tell you that of edible turtles
the green variety is the best. Mr. Bellis
imports some three thousand turtles a year.
They arrive in batches of one hundred or more
every fortnight by the Royal Mail steamers from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Kingston, Jamaica, and are obtained from the
coral reefs lying to the north of the island of
Jamaica. Twelve to fifteen small schooners are
employed in the trade, and upwards of a
hundred and twenty men.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A CONSIGNMENT OF TURTLES AT A LONDON TERMINUS.<br />

</div>

<p>These fishers of strange “fish” (the turtle’s
technical name) stretch nets of twine from rock
to rock, and the moment the turtle feels itself
entangled it clings tenaciously to the meshes,
and is then hauled to the surface. The
schooners in due time return to Kingston with
from eighty to a hundred and fifty of these
remarkable creatures, which are promptly
deposited in palisaded enclosures, flooded at
every tide by the sea. Here they are fed upon
a certain kind of herbage known as “turtle
grass,” and taken as required. The bringing of
these creatures overseas is a very delicate
business, and frequently sixty out of a hundred
perish <i>en route</i>, in spite of the most elaborate
precautions, such as the constant spraying of
salt water daily on board the mail steamer, and
the use of foot warmers for the turtles in the
railway vans from Southampton to Waterloo.
Before now, Mr. Bellis has lost eighty-eight
turtles out of a shipment of a hundred.</p>

<p>This susceptibility to travel is one of the most
remarkable things about the turtle. If you are
anxious to transport him alive it is a hundred
to one he perishes of cold, but if you do succeed
in getting him home the difficulty then is to kill
him. The vitality of this strange sea creature
after decapitation is almost beyond belief. Mr.
Bellis once sent a large turtle to an hotel in
Newcastle. The <i>chef</i> cut the turtle’s head off and
hung the body upside down to bleed. Twenty-four
hours after that turtle knocked down a man
cook with one blow of its fin! The green turtle
is not a vicious creature to handle, like its
snapping Japanese brother, but its fins are very
strong, and one blow from them is quite sufficient
to break a man’s arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank T. Bullen gives a remarkable
instance of the tenacious hold of the turtle upon
life. “On one occasion,” he records, “our men
cut all the flesh and entrails of a turtle away,
leaving only the head and tail attached to the
shell. Some time had elapsed since the meat
had been scooped out of the carapace, and no
one imagined that any life remained in the
extremities. But a young Dane, noticing that
the down-hanging head had its mouth wide open,
very foolishly inserted two fingers between those
horny mandibles. It closed, and our shipmate
was two fingers short, the edges of the turtle’s
jaws had taken them clean off, with only the
muscular power remaining in the head. Then
another man tried to cut the horny tail off, but
as soon as his keen blade touched it on the
underside it curled up and gripped his knife so
firmly that it was nearly an hour before the
blade could be withdrawn.” Signor Redi, the
great zoologist, records how he once cut a turtle’s
head off and noted that it lived for twenty-three
days without a head, and another whose brains
he removed lived for six months.</p>

<p>The green turtle, the species favoured in this
country, is not a carnivorous creature, like the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
snapping-turtle, its food being a particular kind
of sea grass found on the coral reefs in the West
Indies. Some time ago Mr. Bellis brought a
large quantity of this grass to London, with the
idea of feeding the creatures in captivity, but
they refused to take it. In his cellars in the
City one can see any day a number of these
turtles. Here they are kept until a telegram
arrives from a distant hotel, when away goes the
turtle to be turned into soup for the forthcoming
banquet. Those hotels which do not care about
the trouble of killing the creature can procure
the soup in tins and bottles direct from the
importer, and it is not surprising to learn that
large quantities are sold. It requires eight
pounds of the best turtle-flesh to make one
quart of soup.</p>

<p>The green turtle grows to an immense size,
but it has been found that specimens weighing
more than a hundred and fifty pounds are not
desirable, the flesh becoming coarse as the
animal increases in weight. The shell of this
variety is practically valueless, but the hawksbill
turtle yields what is popularly known as
“tortoiseshell,” and the armour covering of a
good specimen may be worth eight pounds. Its
flesh, however, is too coarse for consumption,
though here it should be added that it is doubtful
whether those who occasionally partake of
green-turtle soup would relish that made from
the flesh of the snapping-turtle.</p>

<p>It is a notorious fact that turtles grow very
slowly and attain a great age. Curiously
enough, neither Mr. Hattori nor Mr. Bellis can
tell to what age a snapping or green turtle will
live. Mr. Hattori has quite a number of turtles
that are known to be from thirty to fifty years of
age, while some of the bigger specimens that
arrive at Waterloo for the Bellis cellars are, it is
believed, twelve to fifteen years old.</p>

<h3>THE AMBASSADOR’S TRUNK.<br />

<span class="smcap medium">By E. A. Morphy, late Editor of the “Straits Times,” Singapore.</span></h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> circumstances of this little smuggling
incident, though known to
several persons in the Far East,
have hitherto been hidden, so to
speak, under a bushel. In bringing
them to the light it should be stated that&mdash;for
obvious reasons&mdash;fictitious names have been
given to the individuals
chiefly concerned, but
the facts are just as
stated.</p>

<p>Far and away the most
distinguished passenger
on the big German liner
was the homeward bound
Japanese Ambassador.
He did not look the
part, however. He was a
squat, unobtrusive little
man whose trousers fitted
him badly, and whose
carriage, when he was
hampered by European
clothes, suggested an insignificance
that was only
partially belied by the
intelligence of his homely
countenance. His appearance
reflected no radiant
blaze of glory, yet he
was returning to his
native land crowned with
some of the finest diplomatic
achievements of the
century.</p>

<p>This statement is due
to his Excellency, but
it practically dismisses him from the story,
which mainly concerns his trunk&mdash;his trunk
No. 23, to be precise, for the Ambassador’s
trunks were all numbered. There must have
been half a hundred of them at least; all the
same typical German steel trunks, but distinguished
from other less important trunks of
the same make insomuch
that each one was adorned
with two broad painted
bands of scarlet, which
showed out bravely and
effectually prevented their
being mixed up with any
ordinary baggage. Apart
from all other considerations,
the wisdom of the
Ambassador in thus distinctively
marking his
own trunks lay in the fact
that the process insured
their instant recognition
by the Japanese Customs
officials, by whom they
were immune from examination.</p>

<p>This last fact was the
one which counted for
most with Fritz Vogel,
steward and trombonist
of the liner, as he daily
contemplated the mountain
of luggage and calculated
how many Manila
cigars one of those
great red-striped trunks
would hold.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i030b.jpg">
<img src="images/i030b.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“HE DAILY CONTEMPLATED THE MOUNTAIN OF LUGGAGE
AND CALCULATED HOW MANY MANILA CIGARS ONE OF
THOSE GREAT RED-STRIPED TRUNKS WOULD HOLD.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>
</div>

<p>Carefully packed, he figured it, one might
crowd ten thousand cigars into each trunk.
Ten thousand cigars, at eighty Mexican dollars a
thousand, meant eighty pounds. Duty at one
hundred and fifty per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on eighty
pounds would mean a hundred and twenty
pounds, or, as Fritz Vogel calculated, two
thousand four hundred marks. Therefore, as the
meditative trombonist further worked out the
possibilities, his Excellency could, by simply
loading up a few dozen more trunks with cigars
at Hong-Kong and getting them passed free
through the Customs at Yokohama&mdash;or at
Nagasaki or Kobe for that matter&mdash;make more
in a week than he could hope to earn in a
month of Sundays by sticking to the thorny
paths of diplomacy.</p>

<p>Born west of the Suez, the fertile idea
germinated in Vogel’s brain all through the
dreary wastes of the Canal, and sprouted up
green and vigorous, despite the withering blasts
that pursued the liner down the Red Sea and
across the Indian Ocean to Colombo. At
Singapore it had become an obsession. When
steaming through the Narrows into the latter
port, however, on the way to the German mail
wharf, Vogel observed a red-funnelled Jardine
liner at the Messageries wharf, with the blue-peter
flying.</p>

<p>An hour later the <i>Laisang</i> left for China,
carrying a hastily-written letter from Fritz Vogel
to his friend Max Krebs at Hong-Kong. It
contained a fair statement of the salient facts
in the case, and a crude but lucid sketch of one
of the pieces of baggage, together with a description
of the scarlet bands and full measurements.
It also stated what has not been set forth above&mdash;that
each of his Excellency’s trunks was numbered
in large white figures at each end and on
the top, and it suggested that in the case of any
person desiring to have access to those trunks
whilst they were still on board the liner, Nos.
23, 24, 27, 32, etc., were the easiest to reach.</p>

<p>Mr. Krebs was a “runner” for a native compradoring
firm. He went out to the ships to
“drum up” business for his employers, who
supplied anything and everything that a ship
could require, from cigarettes to engine-oil. In
the old days before the Russian War Mr. Vogel
had done a good deal of trade with Mr. Krebs
on the short run between Yokohama and Hong-Kong.
But the stringent Customs regulations
that had ensued upon the increased tariffs
imposed after the war had practically killed the
business, save so far as concerned a paltry bit
of trading with passengers in faked curios, and
the occasional disposal of a few imitation gems
to homeward-bound tourists when the vessel
was west of Colombo.</p>

<p>Opportunities like the return of an Ambassador
to Japan did not occur once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>The liner tarried a day and a half over cargo
at Singapore, and the <i>Laisang</i> got into Hong-Kong
nearly twenty-four hours ahead of her.
Mr. Vogel learned the fact the moment the
German liner arrived at the big China port, and
his heart was filled with sickening apprehension.
He had been dreaming of trunks full of cigars&mdash;German
steel trunks with red bands, and
numbered with big white characters&mdash;ever since
he left Singapore. He had marked off the state-room
wherein, until the proper psychological
moment, the extra trunks&mdash;if any&mdash;could be
stored safely. He had mentally arranged every
other detail in his projected bid for fortune, and
had even marked down those of his comrades who
should be selected as his accomplices. He had
counted over, time and time again, the round
thousand marks that would be his personal
profit out of every trunk full of cigars he could
pass through the Yokohama Customs as the
baggage of the returning Ambassador. He
did all this while still faithfully, if mechanically,
discharging his onerous duties as steward and
master of the trombone.</p>

<p class="caption">“A NOTE WAS HANDED TO HIM BY A CHINESE MESSENGER.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was not until a few hours after the arrival
of the steamer in Hong-Kong&mdash;hours that felt
like ages&mdash;that Vogel heard from Krebs. A
note was handed to him by a Chinese messenger
boy, and Vogel opened it with feverish impatience.
Mr. Krebs wrote with that laconic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
brevity of diction which indicates the resourceful
mind. “Will send you one trunk.&mdash;O. K.,”
it read.</p>

<p>Mr. Vogel pondered for a moment whether
“O. K.” meant Oscar Krebs or “All correct”
(American fashion); then he heaved a great
sigh of relief as he realized that it was all the
same.</p>

<p>That evening Mr. Krebs came on board
unostentatiously, and a big trunk wrapped in
rough sacking came with him, and was temporarily
stowed
away by Mr.
Vogel in one of
the state-rooms
which held
some of the
Ambassador’s
spare boxes.
Thence it was
subsequently
carried to
another cabin,
where there
were some spare
things of Mr.
Vogel’s. Had a
hypercritical
observer subsequently
studied
all the trunks
in the Ambassador’s
collection
he might
have noticed
that one of them appeared to be the least trifle
newer than the rest, but it would have taken a
Sherlock Holmes to detect the circumstance off-hand.
The trunk in question was numbered
“23.”</p>

<p>In due time the liner arrived at Yokohama,
but the mails that had been forwarded overland
from Nagasaki reached there a day before her.
Thus it came about that when the Ambassador’s
baggage was franked through the Custom House
and sent up to the Imperial Hotel at Tokio, two
friends of Messrs. Krebs and Vogel were installed
as guests at the last-named establishment. Thus
also it came about that, thanks to ten yen well
spent on a porter, the Ambassador’s trunk,
No. 23, was whisked away to the nether cellars
of the hotel the moment it arrived there, and&mdash;as
the Ambassador himself did at an earlier stage&mdash;it
virtually passes out of this story. That is
to say, what must have been the ghost of the
Ambassador’s trunk vanishes from mortal view;
but not so the real article. When the diplomat’s
baggage was supposed to be all in, and a count
was taken, trunk No. 23 was found to be missing.</p>

<p>The row that ensued was something awful.
Telegraphs and telephones were called into
requisition, and imperative, not to say drastic,
orders were dispatched to the Customs authorities
at Yokohama, to the railway authorities at
Shimbashi, and to all other authorities everywhere,
commanding them to instantly produce
his Excellency’s missing trunk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i032.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“THEY HAD PASSED IT AND FORWARDED IT, AND GOT A RECEIPT FOR IT.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Customs authorities declared they had
not got the trunk; they had passed it and forwarded
it, and got a receipt for it. There could
be no doubt,
from their point
of view, that the
Ambassador
had taken delivery
of his
trunk No. 23.
The railway
authorities were
equally agreed
on the same
point. The baggage
was all in
special carriages;
not a
pin could have
been lost between
Yokohama
and the
Shimbashi
station at the
capital, whence
it had been
handed over to
his Excellency’s servants for removal to the
hotel. The police authorities were equally
certain that there had been no hanky-panky
business of any kind. It would have
been impossible for one of the Ambassador’s
trunks to go astray or be stolen, either in the
streets of the seaport or in the capital itself.
The steamship authorities had a receipt for every
article. They knew the Ambassador’s trunks, and
especial care had been taken of them throughout
the voyage. Nevertheless, they would again
investigate.</p>

<p>Then, Banzai! there came a telegram from
the chief purser of the liner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Ambassador’s trunk No. 23 found on board.
Must have been left behind inadvertently. Forwarding
to Tokio at once.</i>”</p>

<p>The little Custom House inspectors looked
at the newly-found trunk in utter stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Truly,” said they, “we passed this identical
trunk not three hours ago.”</p>

<p>“<i>Hayako!</i>” (Hurry, there!) shouted the head
inspector, as they dallied over the mystery.
“His Excellency waits!”

<p class="caption">“THE LITTLE CUSTOM HOUSE INSPECTORS LOOKED AT THE NEWLY-FOUND
TRUNK IN UTTER STUPEFACTION.”</p>
</div>

<p>The trunk was expressed up to the Imperial
Hotel by special train.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Director of His Imperial
Majesty’s Customs at Yokohama ordered
a Commission of Inquiry into the matter
of the registering as received and delivered
of one Ambassador’s trunk,
No. 23, when the same had never
either been received from the liner or
delivered to the railway or to any other
authorities by His Imperial Majesty’s
Customs. The matter was also taken
in hand by the Imperial Railway and
by the Tokio and Kanagawa police
authorities.</p>

<p>Though a couple of years have passed
since these investigations were inaugurated,
no definite finding in the matter
has yet been officially published. In
certain quarters, however, there is a consensus
of opinion that such a trunk did
really pass through the Yokohama
Customs, but that it was a phantom one.</p>

<p>Mr. Vogel took away two thousand
two hundred yen (two hundred and
twenty pounds) from Yokohama that trip.
At Hong-Kong, nine days later, he settled
up with Mr. Krebs.</p>

<p>The cigars and trunk had cost nine
hundred dollars, while the expenses
and “commissions” in Japan amounted
to a trifle less than three hundred dollars.
There was a balance of a thousand dollars to
divide, and they duly divided it.</p>

<h3>HALF AN HOUR IN A BLAZING FURNACE.<br />

<span class="smcap medium">By George S. Guy.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable and appalling
experiences possible to conceive recently befell
a young man named Robert Perry, at Apedale,
in Staffordshire. Tramping about the country
in search of work, he arrived one night, utterly
tired out, at an ironworks, and unwittingly took
shelter in an “air furnace,” used for the purpose
of reducing very large pieces of iron, too large
to be dealt with in the ordinary way. As it
happened, the fire-bars of this particular furnace
had been taken out, and Perry had no difficulty
in creeping through the opening and thus
making his way inside. Here he had to mount
a wall five feet in height, and eventually reached
the melting chamber, which at the time contained
about five tons of iron waiting to be
smelted. Arrived at this point, in blissful
ignorance of the dangerous character of the
place he had selected to sleep in, and appreciating
only its dryness and seclusion, he lay
down to rest. Exactly why he should have
selected such a strange bedchamber it is impossible
to say, but tramps have been known to
choose even stranger quarters&mdash;such as lime-kilns
and brick-kilns. Anyhow, the fact remains
that he went into the furnace to sleep. What
happened afterwards is told below, from information
gathered partly from the man himself and
partly from other persons who figured in his
terrible adventure.</p>

<p>After a long walk in the broiling sun Perry
arrived at Apedale quite exhausted, and set
about looking for a snug, dry place where he
could lie down and have a sleep. During his
weary tramp he had been no stranger to curious
resting-places, and he had spent the previous
night under a railway arch. Presently he came
across the smelting works of the Midland Coal,
Coke, and Iron Company, and, seeing a furnace
which he took to be unused, examined it
intently. The wide, open front of the contrivance
looked tempting, and he decided to
make its interior his abode for the night.
Crawling into the opening for some little distance,
he discovered that he had a wall five feet
in height to climb over, but scaled it without
much trouble. Beyond he found himself in
pitch-darkness, but clambered cautiously onwards,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
trying to find
a comfortable place
to lie down. Proceeding
up a slope,
he reached a sort
of chamber beyond,
where a number of
great pieces of iron
were lying about.
Here the weary man
lay down, and,
being very tired, it
did not take him
long to fall asleep.
Let him tell the
manner of his
awakening in his
own words.</p>

<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I do not exactly
know what awoke
me, but upon trying
to raise myself a
frightful choking
feeling came over
me, and I became
conscious of great
heat. Then, like a
flash, I realized what
a dreadful mistake
I had made, and
what a terrible
situation I was in.
The furnace was <i>not</i>
disused, and now
the workmen had lit it, and I was a prisoner
inside! For a moment I felt sick with horror,
but it did not take me long to pull myself
together and try to find a way out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i034b.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">PLAN OF THE FURNACE&mdash;THE CROSS DENOTES WHERE PERRY SLEPT.</p>
</div>

<p>The whole place was in total darkness.
Although I could hear a dull roaring somewhere,
and feel the waves of heated air and
fumes passing over me, I could not see the
slightest sign of any light. Tremblingly I felt
up and down the
sides of my prison
to see if I could find
a door, but nothing
of the kind could I
discover. I tried to
retreat farther into
the furnace to get
away from that awful
heat, but had to
return and face it
again. Now, with
a sickening heart,
I saw that flames
were approaching
my position. Thinking
my end was near
at hand, I decided
at all costs to go
down the slope.
This meant that I
must face the fire,
which was now licking
up towards me,
sucked inwards by
the tremendous
draught. Shivering
with horror I made
the attempt, but the
heat and flames were
unendurable, and
beat me back. Then,
crouching down, I
worked myself along
the side, thinking
this my best plan. At last&mdash;Heaven alone
knows how&mdash;I reached the foot of the wall.
In a half-dazed, choking condition, I tried to
climb up, but was met by a veritable hurricane
of fierce flames, which knocked me down and
burnt all the hair off my head. Half-blinded,
scorched, and with my brain benumbed from
the effects of the fumes, I still did not quite
lose heart: something seemed to force me on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
to make a struggle for life. Suddenly, as I
lay there gasping in that inferno of heat
and flame, I heard voices outside, but I
could not understand what was said. I wondered
dully whether, if I called out, the men
I could hear speaking would hear me, so,
in my agony of physical suffering and mental
distress, I shouted, “O Lord, save me! O
Lord, save me!” The murmur of voices still
went on, but presently one man evidently heard
my cries, and called out to a “Mr. Phillips”
that he thought he heard a shout for help. This,
however, Mr. Phillips&mdash;who seemed to be the
foreman&mdash;ridiculed, and they went on working
as before.</p>

<p>I was now on the verge of giving up; my
strength seemed to be failing me, but I decided
to make one final attempt to get on the wall.
I am glad to say that it was not in vain, and
after a desperate struggle I succeeded in reaching
the top. This seemed to renew my energy,
and I braced myself for what I knew was my
last hope. I gave one horrified glance at the
furnace below, the flames
roaring and leaping madly,
and then, with all the strength
of my fire-scorched lungs, I
shrieked out once more, “O
Lord, save me!”</p>

<p>The men outside stopped
work at once.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?”
cried one, excitedly; “I
heard it quite distinctly that
time; someone is shouting
out ‘Lord, save me’!” This
time Mr. Phillips admitted
that he <i>did</i> think he heard
a noise as if someone was
calling out, but where could
it come from? It was impossible
for anyone to be in
the furnace alive, for the fire
had been going for some
time. Then someone else
said, “Open the fire-door
and see if you can see anything.”</p>

<p>The fire-door! Where
was it, I wondered&mdash;far away
or near at hand? Then, to
my great joy, I heard them
releasing a bolt just a few
feet from where I was. At
last it opened&mdash;a place about
a foot square&mdash;and I saw
daylight streaming in and
then a man’s face. He peered
in anxiously, but evidently
he could not see me, for I was now as black
as the furnace itself. Then he seemed to half-close
the door and I nearly swooned away, for
this was my last chance.</p>

<p>Desperately I strove to shout, but the heat,
flames, and smoke prevented my uttering a
sound save a choking gasp. Fortunately for
myself, however, I moved, and the watcher
happened to catch sight of something about me&mdash;probably
the whites of my eyes shining in
the reflected light. “Good God!” he cried.
“There’s a man in the furnace! Pull the bars
out as quickly as you can.”</p>

<p class="caption">“I FOUND MYSELF FALLING&mdash;RIGHT ON TO THE HUGE FIRE.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>
</div>

<p>I did not trouble to
think what or where
the bars were; I knew
only that the men had
seen me and would do
everything in their power
to get me out. I heard
them pulling the bars
out in frantic haste,
and saw Mr. Phillips
trying to squeeze himself
through the small
fire-door.</p>

<p>With my flesh scorching
and my breath
rapidly failing me in
that awful whirlwind of
heat and flame, I put
my arms down for him
to catch hold of. He
seized me by the elbows
and told me to jump,
but this I could not do,
for I felt too far gone.
With that he gave me
a jerk, and I found
myself falling&mdash;right on
to the huge fire! The
bars were out, and the
fire was keeping itself together by the pressure
of one block of coal on another; but when
my weight came upon it, it collapsed, sending
up a rush of flames
all around me. To
my intense horror, I
felt the skin on my
arms giving way, but
the courageous Mr.
Phillips did not
release his hold. His
hands were now on
my wrists, and, exerting
all his strength, he
pulled me up towards
the door.</p>

<p>The pain of my
burns was simply fearful,
and I could have
shrieked with agony,
but somehow, except
for a few moans, I
kept quiet.</p>

<p class="caption">ROBERT PERRY AS HE APPEARED AFTER HIS DISCHARGE FROM

[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>Presently the foreman
succeeded in
pulling me out of the
small door, but I felt
as if dead, and as
though I was shrivelling
up and growing
smaller. As I lay on
the ground, in agonizing
pain, I appealed to the
men to strangle me.
Again and again, in semi-delirium,
I repeated the
request: “I’m done for!
Strangle me! strangle
me!” My whole body
seemed to be on fire,
but my rescuers lost no
time. Procuring some
oil, they saturated me
with it, thus, in a measure,
soothing the pain. Then
they got me on to an
ambulance and rushed
me off to the Chell
Infirmary, where I received
every care and
attention.</p>

<p>Never, so long as I
live, shall I forget the
terrible time I endured
in the furnace, and my
unspeakable joy when I
saw Mr. Phillips at the
fire-door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am indebted to Mr. Hill, the general
manager of the above-mentioned company, for
a plan of the furnace. It may be interesting
to add that, even had
Perry contrived to
shelter himself from
the flames at the foot
of the wall he mentions,
he would very
soon have met with a
death too awful to
contemplate, as the
molten iron would
have flowed down and
overwhelmed him. The
authorities inform me
that Perry’s adventure
is altogether unprecedented
in the whole of
their experience. At
the moment when his
first cry was heard the
furnace had been alight
for some considerable
time, having been
started with a large
quantity of wood and
many barrow-loads of
hot coal in order to
raise the heat quickly!</p>

<h3>THE HEADLESS WOMAN.<br />

<span class="smcap medium">By Charles Needham.</span></h3>

<p>I had just recovered from a troublesome
throat affection, and under the doctor’s orders
had moved out of town for a spell of fresh air
and quieter surroundings, selecting the little
village of Canewdon, in South-East Essex, as my
retreat. I had always had an eye on the village,
first making its acquaintance whilst yachting off
the coast and in the River Crouch, where my
boat had its permanent berth.</p>

<p>Canewdon is actually little more than a straggling
hamlet four miles by road to the north of
Rochford, and about nine from Southend-on-Sea.
It required only a very short residence
there for me to find that the secluded little place
considered it had its own corner in history, and
a very pretty turn in folk-lore and superstition as
well. To begin with, Canewdon claims King
Canute as one of its founders, and its domestic
romances and tragedies would make a presentable
volume in the hands of a scribbling
antiquary. It had, however, something more
than mere history, and far less to my liking, for
me to feed my imagination upon, as I was soon
to discover.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i037.jpg">

<p class="caption">THE OLD COTTAGE AT CANEWDON IN WHICH THE AUTHOR RESIDED.<br />
<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>After a good look round I settled upon a
comfortable old cottage, with a small garden
traversed by a brook, only a very short distance
from the ancient, square-towered church. Into
this, having taken it at a very moderate rental,
I moved a small amount of furniture, my books,
and other paraphernalia, and prepared to settle
down to the life of a hermit for a time. The
woman who came from close by to “do” for
me looked upon me, I fancy, as something of a
curiosity, but, for some reason I had not then
discovered, she seemed a little uneasy at my
solitary existence. She would remark that I
must be lonely, or that it was unlikely that I
should stop in the place very long. I put all
this down to a friendly disposition, coupled with
a desire to draw me out as to my place in the
larger world I had dropped from so suddenly.</p>

<p>For the first day or two matters went
smoothly enough, and I began to feel that
my choice of locality had been a lucky and
inexpensive one. Then something occurred
which startled me sufficiently to make me alter
my opinion.</p>

<p>I always used the little kitchen at meal-times
for convenience’ sake, and one night I remained
there reading until very late, the kitchen being
lit only by one small lamp at my back. I had
just closed my book&mdash;it was about one o’clock&mdash;and
was summoning the effort required to take
me bedwards, when I noticed a very slight
movement of the iron latch upon the door
leading into the back garden. My thoughts
naturally flew to burglars. The locality was
lonely, and no doubt my coming had been duly
talked over in the village with all the exaggeration
and surmise an out-of-the-way place is
capable of.</p>

<p>I was, of course, considerably startled, and
sat watching the latch slowly rise, evidently
actuated by a very delicate and even pressure
from without. The door itself was bolted at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
both top and bottom, and when the latch had
risen clear of the hasp I fully expected to hear
the bolts rattle as the person outside put his
weight against the door to try it. But nothing
of the sort happened; the latch, after remaining
suspended for a moment, fell back again into
place as slowly and evenly as it had risen.</p>

<p>Startled and puzzled as I was, I still held to
my belief that this must be a timid attempt at
robbery, and that, finding the back door locked,
the intruder would try the front one also. Nor
was I wrong, for I had scarcely slipped quietly
into the sitting-room and taken up my position
when the latch there began to rise in precisely
the same manner. This door possessed only
one bolt, and that at the bottom, so that
the door, an old and ill-fitting one, would
show the slightest pressure at once. But
none was placed upon it, and the latch fell
into place as evenly and noiselessly as before.
By this time I must confess to being slightly
scared, and when a chair banged heavily on the
floor and a loud shout of “Who’s that?”
brought no sound of a retreating shuffle on the
cobble-stones outside, I had to summon all my
remaining courage to unbar and fling open the
door. Not a soul or a sound met me as I
stepped outside. The night was a light one in
early September, so that a retreating figure could
have been followed by the eye for twenty or
thirty yards. After a careful look round the
garden I went to bed nonplussed at the
weirdness of the whole affair.</p>

<p>The following day brought another intruder&mdash;a
material one this time. I found that during
the morning a travelling caravan had taken a
pitch just outside my hedge; and its owner
turned out to be an Oxford man, who, with his
wife, was leading a vagabond life about the
shires. He was an extremely well-read man,
and we soon got on the best of terms, exchanging
books and opinions, till he inspanned for pastures
new a week later. The night before he left I
was treated to another queer happening.</p>

<p>We had been talking and reading in my tiny
sitting-room till about eleven o’clock, when my
vagabond friend bade me a sleepy “Good night”
and opened the front door. He had, however,
only just put his foot on the cobbles when he
stepped backwards with a sharp exclamation,
and a scared look on his face.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully queer,” he replied; “I could
have sworn I saw a face looking straight at me
close to that bush”&mdash;he pointed to the privet
hedge at the left of the door&mdash;“but there didn’t
seem to be any body to it. I’m certainly not
drunk, but I may have been dreaming.”</p>

<p>After my recent experience, which I had not
thought it worth while to mention to such a
hard-headed soul as my chance companion, I
felt anything but comfortable. We were both
rather ashamed of our brief lapse from common
sense, and laughed the incident off as best we
might.</p>

<p>The following day found me in all the doubtful
glory of my solitude once more, and I must
confess to having been thankful when an invitation
reached me that same evening, from friends
at Fambridge, for a few days’ fishing.</p>

<p>I have never suffered from that popular
present-day malady known as “nerves,” possibly
because of an open-air existence with plenty of
exercise, but, though I had only been there a
short time, the cottage and the locality now
seemed to have become almost uncanny to me.
Had I mixed more with the inhabitants, I
should have discovered, as I did later, that this
strange feeling was not without some foundation.</p>

<p>The few days I spent in Fambridge put all
thought of the two queer incidents out of my
mind, which will show that the subsequent
events were not the outcome of an overtaxed
imagination or a course of long brooding upon
disquieting phenomena.</p>

<p>It must have been about nine o’clock in the
evening that my Fambridge friend put a little
Welsh pony into his governess-car to drive me
back the four odd miles to my cottage. The
night was fine, but there were clouds about and
no moon, so that objects outside the radius of
the lamps were hard to distinguish. The pony
had already had a fairly hard day of it along the
coast, but he was a sturdy little beast and pulled
like a steam-engine, rattling us down to the outskirts
of Canewdon in excellent time.</p>

<p>We had been bowling along, talking about the
day’s sport, and were now rapidly nearing a stile
leading to a footpath upon the left of the road,
which takes one by a short cut across a field,
over another stile, into the churchyard, and so
into the village High Street. We had barely
reached the stile when the pony pulled up short,
reared, and refused to go another step in that
direction. The pony, always a strong and
willing little chap, had never done such a thing
in his life before, and my friend was not only
puzzled but annoyed. A sound beating had no
more effect than words of encouragement; there
the little beggar stuck, his four legs splayed out,
the picture of all that was most stubborn in
nature, whilst we two sat in the car trying to
devise some plan by which to budge him.</p>

<p>My friend was at last obliged to ask me to
take the short cut I have just spoken of instead
of being driven round by the road the remaining
mile and a half to my cottage. I was, of course,
willing enough. The short cut would take me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
barely ten minutes, and I had very little to
carry; so, bidding him “Good night,” I jumped
out. As I came from behind the trap I noticed
a tiny flickering light a few yards ahead, upon
the left-hand side of the road, but it was very
dim and did not arrest my attention sufficiently
to make any impression on the mind. I was
able to lead the pony round without any
difficulty, and when his head faced Fambridge
he seemed to recover his spirits at once, and
the red points behind the lamps receded at a
rattling pace up the road. When these had
disappeared I turned again to climb the stile,
but became at once uneasily
conscious of something
unusual a little way
ahead of me.</p>

<p>The spot the pony had
refused at was a good
deal shadowed by large
elms, and these, together
with the cloudy sky,
made the road still more
obscure. The small light,
which I had taken little
notice of at first&mdash;thinking
it probably one of
the village lights showing
through the trees&mdash;was
still ahead; only, instead
of being upon the left of
the road, it was now upon
the right. For a few
seconds I stood looking
at it, feeling very much
like turning tail and bolting
down the road. The
flame, for it was no other,
showed greeny&mdash;white
against the black background
and shivered in
a strange, eerie way.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary
part of the business
was that it seemed to
come from nothing
visible, but to appear,
as it were, burning in
space three or four feet
above the road.</p>

<p class="caption">“THIS MYSTERIOUS SOMETHING TOOK THREE RAPID STRIDES ACROSS THE ROAD AND
DISAPPEARED.”</p>
</div>

<p>I had, of course, read
ghost stories in which
“corpse candles” and
ghostly lights of one
sort and another
figured largely, but I
had never expected to
come across one, and
this could be translated
in no other way.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The close proximity of the
churchyard, with the square tower of the church
itself showing through the trees, added too
much colour to the scene to my liking; but,
scared though I was, a certain fascination took
hold of me, and I advanced a step or two in
order to examine the phenomenon at closer
range. I had scarcely taken two paces, however,
when the clouds parted a little, giving a
better light beneath the trees, and at the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
moment the weird flame flickered wildly and
went out.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
The light somewhat resembled the <i>ignis fatuus</i>, or will-o’-the-wisp,
but was larger and greener in colour. Moreover, there was
no pond or marshy ground anywhere near the road.</p></div>

<p>But this was not to be the end of my ghostly
experience. The stronger light brought many
roadside objects into prominence, and the
moment the flame disappeared I became conscious
of an indistinct black blotch against the
lighter background of the hedge. It was, of
course, too dark for me to be certain of its
exact shape, even had I been in a calm enough
state of mind to take in details; but in any case
I was allowed only a momentary glimpse, for
whilst I stood with the breath caught in my
throat, this mysterious something took three
rapid strides across the road and disappeared
without a sound into the thick hawthorn hedge
opposite.</p>

<p>At this stage I must confess to having lost all
control of myself. Without another look I took
to my heels and ran, as though all the powers of
darkness were behind me.</p>

<p>The scare I had got made me quite oblivious
of my direction, but I suppose natural instinct
guided me, for I found myself at last, almost
pumped out, trotting into the little High Street
of Canewdon by the road along which I should
have driven, and no doubt in far better time.
I had no relish, in my then state of mind, for
another lonely night in the cottage, although it
stood only fifty yards away, so I made my way
to the Chequers, the only inn the village possessed,
and asked for a bed.</p>

<p>My recent arrival in the place had given me
little time to become acquainted with the village
notables, but I fancy the landlady knew me by
sight, and no doubt thought the request strange.
In any case her “Certainly, sir,” was followed
by a close scrutiny. “You’re looking very queer,
sir,” she added; “has anything happened?”</p>

<p>Surrounded by more human elements, I began
to feel thoroughly ashamed of myself, and rather
doubted the wisdom of giving the narrative away;
but the thought that, perhaps, being a resident,
she might be able to throw some light upon my
weird experience finally decided me to make a
clean breast of the whole affair; and I promptly
did so in the little inn-parlour.</p>

<p>I had barely got half-way through the incident
upon the road when she sat back in her chair,
and said in a quiet, almost matter-of-fact
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ve seen the headless woman, sir.”</p>

<p>“The headless woman?” I asked, startled.
“Who’s she?”</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you,” she replied, “though
we don’t talk of it much here. Have you noticed
a wooden house painted white, and standing
alone about a hundred yards this way from the
stile on the Fambridge road?”</p>

<p>I said that I had, and thought it was a farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Well, so it was till the murder happened,”
replied the woman. “The story goes that somewhere
about forty years ago a farmer there took
to drink, went mad, and murdered his wife. He
didn’t stop at that, either, for he cut off her head
and buried it, and it wasn’t found till some time
after the body had had decent burial.”</p>

<p>“So she’s supposed to haunt the place?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“There’s no suppose about it, sir,” she
replied, very quietly; “a tidy few people here
have seen her, much the same as you did. My
husband has, too, by the stile leading into the
churchyard. It took him a week in bed to get
over it. Sometimes it’s just a face, and sometimes
just a black bundle like a body without a
head; but always near one of them two stiles,
and round about harvest time. Heaven send I
never see the sight!” she concluded, devoutly.</p>

<p>“I’m not particularly anxious to renew the
acquaintance myself,” I replied, “but how do
you account for the lifting of my latch?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say for certain, sir, but, if my
memory serves me, there was a gaffer living in
your cottage&mdash;he’s dead now many a year&mdash;who
used to work at the White House and was there
when the murder happened. He saw her pretty
often in his garden, I’m told, but couldn’t be
got to speak of it. It may be she walks there
too.”</p>

<p>I spent a very mixed kind of night at the inn,
and on the following day returned to Fambridge
and less ghostly company. From here I made
arrangements for a change of quarters, and from
that day to this I have not set eyes upon
Canewdon, nor have I any inclination to do so.</p>

<p>This strange happening is perhaps too strange
for everybody’s belief. My “spirituous” state
at the time is an opinion largely held by chaffing
friends; but I ask that three points be taken
into consideration. I am practically a teetotaller;
my imagination is no more abnormal
than that of most of my fellows; and, lastly, no
whisper of ghostly visitations in the village had
reached my ears prior to the narrative as told
by the landlady.</p>

<p>The whole affair would make an interesting
little piece of investigation for the Psychical
Research Society.

<h2><span class="hidden">SOME SAVAGE PASTIMES.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap medium">By E. Way Elkington</span>, F.R.G.S.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Savages, big and little, play games like
other folk, and some of their methods
of amusing themselves are very curious
indeed. Mr. Elkington has made a
collection of the least-known and most
peculiar pastimes, and here describes
and illustrates them.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Throughout</span> the world there is
a peculiar similarity in the games of
the human race, and undoubtedly
they all spring from the same sources,
being the result of imitation, by
children, of the duties and pleasures of the
elder generation. In the savage races, however,
we find them in their most primitive and
interesting state, and in this article I propose
to describe a few of the least known and most
peculiar&mdash;some which I have myself witnessed,
and others that I have collected from well-known
travellers.</p>

<p>As with ourselves, it is not only the children
who play, and the pastimes of their grown-up
brothers are equally interesting. Naturally
the games of the elders require more skill, and
in some cases considerably more endurance and
fortitude. For instance, the whip game, played
by the red-men of British Guiana, is one that
calls forth the most enduring qualities of these
sturdy natives, and is an ordeal in which few
Englishmen would care to take part. The
origin of it is not known; some say that it was
originally an act in a burial scene, but more
probably it is a festival game.</p>

<p>For all functions in Guiana a copious supply
of drink is prepared, the local name of which is
“paiwarie.” This is a native-made fermented
liquor, which has the desired effect, in its preliminary
stages, of putting the drinkers into a good
humour. After a certain quantity of “paiwarie”
has been handed round, the players of the whip
game, men and boys, line up in two rows facing
one another; each is provided with a whip ornamented
with fibre tassels, those of the two end
players having whistles attached. When all is
ready a gentle stamping is commenced, which
gradually grows louder and louder till the earth
begins to throb and the players show signs of
getting worked up. Then shouts of “Yau,
au!” are heard, and the now excited players
wave their whips and sway gently backwards
and forwards as they stamp their feet. Presently
the two end men with the whistles attached
to their whips pass down the centre of
the row, whilst those lined up move slowly
in an opposite direction. Now the stamping
increases and the whistlers whistle at each
other in wild excitement. Then they begin
waving their whips at one other, feigning to
strike with tremendous force, but finally they
come down on their opponents’ calves with only
a mere touch. After this has gone on for some
time the two leaders run back to their original
places at the head of the row, and others go out
and do as they have done.</p>

<p>When all the players have gone through this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
exhibition the real business begins; so far it has
only been play.</p>

<p>The women now come on to the scene
bearing calabashes of wine, which is greedily
swallowed, and then two of the players challenge
each other to a real whipping competition.</p>

<p>Silence soon prevails, and the onlookers take
up their places ready to watch this extraordinary
ordeal.</p>

<p>As soon as the challenge has been accepted
the two men step out in front of the audience
and stand facing each other. As a rule they
are splendidly-built fellows, and as they wear
practically no clothing for this ceremony, their
physical development is very noticeable.</p>

<p>Cautiously they judge their distance, letting
the lash of the whip just touch their adversary’s
calf. When they have thoroughly satisfied
themselves that they can get a perfect swing,
one of them stands firmly, half turned away
from the other, who immediately swings his
whip with tremendous force and brings it down
on his opponent’s calf with a crack like the report
of a gun.</p>

<p class="caption">THE EXTRAORDINARY “WHIP GAME” OF BRITISH GUIANA&mdash;THE COMPETITORS SLASH AT ONE ANOTHER’S BARE LEGS IN
TURN, OFTEN CUTTING DEEP INTO THE FLESH.<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>The man who has received this blow, though
it has in all probability cut right into his calf,
does not flinch, but joins the whipper in a wild
sort of dance, accompanied by loud shouts of
“Yau, au!” Again the same man presents his
calf to be cut at, again the lash descends, and
more dancing follows, until it is time for the
other man to go through the same ordeal. When
he has had his share the two adjourn to the hut
and indulge freely in “paiwarie,” and other
players take their places, until all the grown-ups
have tasted of the delights of the game. The
younger fry then step forth and challenge each
other. Women, of course, do not take any active
part in this weird performance beyond handing
round the drinks.</p>

<p>Though this is rather a strenuous game, there
are many less painful ones with which the
children amuse themselves. One of these,
called the “Jaguar Game,” is similar to our own
“Fox and Geese.” A long procession of boys
line up and grip each other by the shoulders,
and sway backwards and forwards crying out,
“There is no jaguar to-day!” Whilst they are
singing this merrily, a youngster bears down upon
them from his hiding-place amongst the onlookers.
He comes running along on his hands and one
leg, the other leg being raised in the air to
represent the tail of the jaguar. On his appearance
the whole line of boys is thrown into
confusion; they grow wildly excited and swerve
and sway, and dodge round, always keeping in a
long, snake-like line, with the foremost boy facing
their adversary, the jaguar. It is the jaguar’s
duty to catch the last one in the row and bear
him off to his lair.</p>

<p>Sometimes this game is varied by the jaguar
having two young cubs with her, who also run
on “all threes”; they add greatly to the excitement
of the sport by snapping, snarling, and
generally behaving as young cubs should. The
game goes on till all the row has been captured.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<p>In the “Monkey Game” laughter reaches its
highest point, for this is one of the wildest they
play; and not only the children indulge in it,
but the grown-up men sometimes take it into
their heads to play it, when it assumes a very
different aspect. With the children it is pure
fun, with little or no danger attaching to it.</p>

<p>A crowd of youngsters line up and move
about like monkeys who are merely enjoying
themselves. Suddenly one of them stops and
gives vent to a shriek of fear; the others take
up the cry and immediately break their line
and run wildly all over the place, chattering
excitedly. When the simulated panic is at its
height the smaller boys spring on to the backs of
the bigger ones,
and are raced about
all over the place
till fatigue puts an
end to the fun.
When their elders
play the “Monkey
Game,” however,
they often become
so worked up that
they really behave
like a crowd of
monkeys gone
stark, staring mad.</p>

<p>Sir Everard F. im
Thurn, K.C.M.G.,
at present Governor
of Fiji, to whom I
am indebted for
the photographs of
these Guiana
games, relates a
most trying experience
he went
through during one
of these mad frolics.
He says that the
players suddenly
burst in amongst the huts, swarmed up the
roofs, tearing great mouthfuls of thatch away in
their flight, and then dashed into the rooms,
upsetting everything they came across and
destroying food and furniture. “The old man
of the settlement and his wife, in real anxiety
for their goods, tried to protect what they
could, tearing it even from out of the
’monkeys’’ hands or throwing food to them
to distract their attention from more valuable
property. At last, with the help of two bystanders,
the old man secured the more violent
of the players, and, despite some too genuine
scratchings and bitings, managed to fasten them
by ropes round their loins, monkey-wise, to the
posts of houses. At last five had been so caught
and tied in one house; and then, if there had
been uproar before, there was pandemonium
now. The captives screamed and shrieked and
yelled; they rolled as far as their cords would
allow, and tore with their teeth everything that
came in their way: food, clothes, hammocks,
pans, and calabashes.... The whole mighty
uproar only ceased when all were literally too
tired to do more.”</p>

<p>This quaint instance of a game running away
with its players seems strange to us, but
probably if a savage saw some of our football
matches he, too, might think the players had
suddenly gone mad.</p>

<p class="caption">THE “SHIELD GAME,” IN WHICH THE COMPETITORS ENDEAVOUR TO PUSH ONE
ANOTHER OVER&mdash;TRIBAL DISPUTES ARE OCCASIONALLY SETTLED WITHOUT
BLOODSHED BY CHOSEN TEAMS.<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>The “Shield Game” is another pastime of the
grown-up natives.
In this each man
is provided with a
strong shield made
of palm-leaf stalks.
Armed with this
he faces his opponent.
After much
preliminary stamping
and feigning
they close and a
mighty struggle
commences, in
which each man
endeavours to push
his adversary back.
It is a kind of tug-of-war
reversed.
Besides being a
game, it is often
used as a means
to settle disputes,
in which, of course,
the strongest man
wins. The accompanying
photograph
gives an
excellent idea of
the pastime. Occasionally when tribes fall out a
whole line of experts are chosen from each side,
and the dispute is settled without bloodshed by
the success of either side. It will be gleaned
from this that the quality of “pushfulness” has
an added value in British Guiana.</p>

<p>To go back to the games of children and also
to jump a few thousand miles to the west, we
find some interesting and curious pastimes
among the aboriginals of Australia, where the
young idea copies the ways of its fathers and
makes games of their serious ceremonies.
Amongst other things they play at marriage,
taking some of the romantic details prior to the
ceremony to make their game. In some parts
of Australia an aboriginal has first to catch his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
wife before he can marry her, and the youngsters
have probably heard from their mothers that
this was not always the easiest thing to do,
for there may have been others anxious to wed
her&mdash;provided always that she was a good
worker, looks being of small account. So the
children have taken all these things into consideration
and made their game from them.</p>

<p>As these aborigines have no proper villages,
but live in shelters thrown together in the most
primitive fashion, the children choose a spot in
the bush where Nature has made a sort of
covering; they then congregate and imitate
grown-up people, chattering about nothing in
particular, whilst the young man hovers round in
the bush. Suddenly he bears down on the
players and attempts to abduct one of the girls.
This arouses the others, who all try to stop him,
and one of the young gallants attacks the would-be
abductor and a mock fight ensues, the
winner bearing the maiden off in triumph to
the bush.</p>

<p class="caption">AN AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL CORROBOREE<br />
<i>From a Photo. by permission of the Queensland Government.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Amongst the men there are few real games;
they all seem to take life rather seriously, and
as soon as they are grown up they devote their
whole time to obtaining food and taking part in
the numerous religious ceremonies, some of
which are most elaborate and trying functions.
To us these may appear very like games, but to
the aborigines they are particularly sacred. Of late
years, however, they have turned one or two of
these ceremonies into dances or corroborees,
but probably this has been done to amuse the
whites and extract money from them&mdash;like the
Maoris, who now dance the “Haka” as if it were a
spectacular dance for the benefit of the Pakeha.
With the coming of civilization and peace
some phases of its serious import have gone.
The photograph given above shows Australian
aborigines performing the kangaroo dance,
which is a modified exhibition of one of their
ancient ceremonies. It is not an exciting affair,
nor beautiful, as these savages are not adepts
at dancing. All they do is to crawl about,
stamping and gesticulating, whilst the man
dressed as a kangaroo goes backwards and forwards
and up and down the line with a sort of
high-stepping action. This kangaroo dance at
one time had a significant meaning, and was
probably danced in connection with an old-time
legend, but, like many similar ceremonies,
it is now carried on simply because the
ancestors of the present generation taught it.
This in itself would be quite sufficient to keep
the most absurd custom alive, for ancestors are
held in great reverence amongst savages.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing games I have ever
witnessed in savage lands was in New Zealand,
where I saw a crowd of children dancing an
imitation “Haka.” The “Haka,” when danced
seriously by grown-ups, is a most awe-inspiring
and thrilling exhibition which stirs every
nerve in your body; but when children
dance it, it becomes a grotesque and laughable
affair. The Maoris, men, women, and
children, have a well-developed sense of
humour, which is more than most savages have,
and the word “savage” hardly applies to them,
for more civilized and Christian beings would be
hard to find. When white men first came in
contact with them they found them anything
but civilized except in their ideas of justice, in
which they were able to give us lessons; in
hospitality even now they can put a white man
to shame. However, for the purpose of this
article I will call them savages.</p>

<p>The children from their earliest days begin to
laugh. I do not remember ever seeing one cry&mdash;and
they seem to spend the rest of their days
with a smile hovering somewhere near their
faces, ready at the slightest provocation to come
out. As the “Haka” is composed of a series
of body movements, in which facial expression
plays a prominent part, the children have plenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
of scope to caricature the whole performance,
which they turn into a merry pantomime,
stamping and shouting, rolling their eyes,
and hanging out their tongues in curious
imitation of the real performers. The girls,
too, have their dances, and
these are really both pretty
and interesting, for they are
handsome creatures who
know they are good looking,
and enjoy showing themselves
off to the best advantage, as
one can see by the pretty and
fascinating movements of the
various dances they practise.
The only thing that mars
them is their anxiety to make
grotesque faces every now
and then, but perhaps this
too is done by way of contrast.
The men have the
same failing, and though their
expressions are more savage
they do not add to the charm
of the dances. To perform
a dance of welcome in front
of a visiting tribe, and pull
horrible faces at them the
while, is hardly likely to make
the visitors feel at home, but
the Maoris understand it,
and so do not get cross, as
you and I might.</p>

<p>In the Solomon Islands, British New Guinea,
and the New Hebrides the children are also of
a playful disposition and have many games
which resemble ours, such as leap-frog and
pick-a-back, whilst the elder generation have
musical instruments resembling
the jews’ harp, the

FLAGEOLET WITH HIS NOSE.<br />
<i>From a Photo. by E. H. Man.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Certain musical instruments
are more or less
common all over the world,
but often the method of
playing them differs, as the
accompanying photograph
will show. It represents a
young Nicobarese playing a
reed flageolet with his nose!
Lots of people in the most
civilized lands sing through
their noses, but playing
through them is, I believe,
only practised in savage
lands. In these same islands
the natives have a sounding-board
which I suppose they
would call a musical instrument,
for it takes the place
of the well-known tom-tom
used in other countries. Here
it is beaten to keep time for
dancers. It is a curiously
constructed instrument,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
resembling a native shield; in fact, some
travellers have mistaken it for one. Scooped
out of the trunk of a tree in the same way that
ordinary dug-out canoes are made, it is about
five feet long and two or three feet broad;
like a shield, it is concave in shape. One of
the ends is pointed, and when in use this
is stuck in the ground diagonally; a stone
is placed under the other end to raise it. To
play it the native plants one foot firmly on the
buried end whilst he strikes the board with his
disengaged foot.</p>

<p>“Musical” entertainments are popular in
the Nicobar Islands, and the young men vie
with each other in composing ditties which
they hope will become popular and thus make
them famous. So far none of these songs have
been pirated in England, but this does not say
that in the islands they are not “all the go.”
Such tunes are composed to be sung to the
accompaniment of the sounding-board and
dances. These, among the women, resemble
more than anything else the antics of timid
ladies bathing at the seaside. The dancing of
the men is not much help to the musician
either, as it consists of a few movements rather
like dumb-bell exercises for chest development,
so that it can be understood that the young
Nicobarese has no light task before him when
he seeks fame in composition.</p>

<p>On the West Coast of Africa there is a remarkably
interesting dance in which the movements
of the dancer supply the “music.” For
the particulars of this dance and for the photograph
of the performers I have to thank Mr.
T. J. Alldridge, some time District Commissioner.
The native dancing girls wear most
fantastic garments. Their bodies are covered
with a net made of native cotton, from which
hang great bunches of palm-leaf fibre. Tufts
of the same material decorate their wrists
and waists, and some wear curious knicker-bockers.
To these latter garments are attached
small pieces of hollow iron, from which rings
are hung, and when the dancer gets in full
swing these make a curious jingling noise. An
accompaniment is also played by other women
on another quaint instrument called a <i>sehgura</i>,
which is made out of a hollow gourd covered
with a net, on which are fixed a number of
seeds. To produce the sound the ends of the
net are held in the two hands and tightened
and slackened alternately, while rhythmic
shaking is now and then indulged in to vary
the accompaniment.</p>

<p>In this part of the world there are several
interesting games of chance, for natives are
inveterate gamblers and will stake all they
possess&mdash;huts, wearing apparel, and even their
wives. One of their favourite pastimes is
played with a concave board, which is put on
the ground facing the players, who stand or
squat a little way off. They then spin a sort of
top into and across it until one of them fails to
send it with sufficient force to carry it to the
far end; it is then the business of the next
man to spin his top with sufficient force to drive
his opponent’s out, and so beat him.</p>

<p>Gambling seems to be common in all parts of
the world; the Eskimo have many interesting
games where chance and skill are combined.
One called “nuglutang” is very popular and is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
played by several
men at a time.
From the centre
of the room
(generally from
the roof) is slung
a plate of ivory
having a hole in
its centre. The
Eskimos stand
away from it, and
each in turn endeavours
to throw
a stick through
the orifice. In one
of their games,
called “saketan,”
they have a
curious way of
“staking.” The
game is a sort of
roulette; a board
is placed on the
ground, and a
small cup with
rounded bottom
and a lip is spun
on to it. The
man in front of
whom the lip
stops is the winner,
but, unlike most
winners, he is actually
a loser, for he
has to go and fetch something to pay in as a
stake, which the next “winner” takes, but he
in turn pays in another forfeit in its place for
the man who follows. So the game goes on
until the last man wins,
and he appropriates the
stakes out and out, making
himself the only real
winner, whereas the first
player to whom the cup
pointed is the only loser
in a game which causes
the wildest excitement
whilst the issue is in
doubt.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar thing that
string games, like some
others already mentioned,
are popular all
over the world
amongst the
coloured races,
and what is perhaps
far more extraordinary
is the
fact, recently discovered,
that some
of these string
figures are made
in exactly the same
way, and are of
the same design
in places as widely
apart as America,
the South Sea
Islands, and
Japan. The last
photograph, taken
by Mr. William
A. Cunnington,
shows a very
interesting string
figure from Central
Africa called
“Sumbo” (a fishing
net), which
is by no means a
simple one.</p>

<p>For the description
of this figure
and permission to
reproduce the
photograph I have to thank the Secretary of
the Anthropological Institute.</p>

<p>Besides having tricks of this sort in which the
hands only are employed, there are many now
known which are made
with hands and feet, and
others again are worked
round the neck and the
hands.</p>

<p>Dr. Haddon has made
a particular study of the
subject, and has, in
collaboration with Dr.
Rivers, published particulars
of many of the
string tricks performed
in various parts of the
world.</p>

<h2 id="The_Marriage_of_Lulu"><i>The Marriage of Lulu.</i><br />

<span class="smcap medium">By the Rev. A. Forder, of Jerusalem.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The author is a missionary who has travelled extensively in the East, and is thoroughly familiar
with the wild tribes of the desert. In the subjoined narrative he relates the love-story of a young
Arab girl&mdash;a real life romance with the conventional happy ending of fiction.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was that time of the day which
Orientals call <i>asr</i>, between four
o’clock and sunset&mdash;just the time
when the Arab chief likes to be on
hand so that he may receive and
welcome any who may seek the hospitality and
shelter afforded by his simple home, and see
for himself that sufficient food for man and
beast is provided, so that both may sup and be
satisfied.</p>

<p>On a certain afternoon Sheikh Khaleel sat
at his tent door watching the sun slowly sink
toward the west, wondering, as he pulled at the
dying embers in his pipe, if it would be his lot
to entertain any guest that night.</p>

<p>As his sharp eyes looked out from under his
shaggy eyebrows he saw in the distance a rider
mounted on a camel, whose head was directed
straight for the camp under the chief’s control.</p>

<p>It was not long before both camel and rider
stood at the door of the guest-tent, and the
chief, having tethered the ship of the desert to
one of the tent-pegs, invited his guest to enter,
and at once set about preparing the coffee
according to Arab custom.</p>

<p>The new arrival, whose name was Abd-el-Thullam
(the servant of cruelty) was well
known to the Arabs for scores of miles round,
and a visit from him always meant something
unusual and of importance, hence the wonder
of the host and his neighbours at the coming
of one with so uninviting a name, which was
obtained by deeds that gave subject for conversation
around many a camp-fire after supper.
Speculations as to the coming of this well-known
chief were many, and although not audibly
expressed filled the minds of all present, and
of none more so than the women, who were
separated from the menfolk only by the coarse
goats’-hair curtain that divided the tent. Little
did the host’s only daughter think that she was
the cause of this unexpected visitor coming
among them, or how much his presence meant
to her and others.</p>

<p>Arab etiquette forbids any direct asking of
questions or quizzing into the affairs of a guest,
so both before and after supper the conversation
was upon subjects far away from the one that
had brought Abd-el-Thullam into the camp of
Sheikh Khaleel, and the simple folk of the
wilderness closed their eyes in sleep without
having the faintest idea of the object of Abd-el-Thullam’s
visit.</p>

<p>With the morning light the camp was astir,
both men and women going about their daily
callings, each one wondering what the day would
reveal. After the matutinal cup of coffee the
guest made known the object of his coming,
doing so in such forceful and measured language
as to impress upon the little company of
listeners the fact that his wishes must be complied
with.</p>

<p>Condensed into a few words, the rather
lengthy speech of the “servant of cruelty” was
somewhat as follows: “Sheikh Khaleel, may
Allah grant you a long life and build your
house (grant you sons to perpetuate your name
and family). To the women of my household I
desire to add another, for has not our Prophet
given us permission to have four wives? Already
I have three. Now I have come to ask for
your daughter, and am ready to give the price
that you may ask for her. As I am to join a
raiding party in a few days the matter must be
settled at once. May Allah give you patience
and wisdom.”</p>

<p>The statement was so unexpected that no one
could make reply for a minute or so. At last
the silence was broken by Khaleel saying, “The
will of Allah be done! What is decreed must
come to pass.”</p>

<p>Now, the business of a betrothal and marriage
is not usually hurried among Arabs, for much
talking is necessary to settle the price of the
bride, and time is needed in which to pay the
amount agreed upon, and to arrange and comply
with the wedding festivities and customs.
Hence Sheikh Khaleel and his neighbours were
surprised in a two-fold way, first by the boldness
of the request, and secondly by the desire to
hasten the matter. So, reminding the impatient
suitor that “God was with the patient ones,”
Khaleel bade him wait a while.</p>

<p>But the man desirous of many wives pressed
his claim and asked the price of the girl, again
saying that he was ready to give whatever was
asked.</p>

<p>All the while Khaleel had been wondering if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
this was not his chance to make a good bargain,
although for two reasons he was loath to part
with his daughter, whose name was Lulu (the
pearl). Was she not his only daughter&mdash;in fact,
the only child Allah had spared to him? Moreover,
although there had been no formal or
public betrothal, he knew well enough that
Lulu’s heart and affections had already been
won by a young man of his own camp and
community. But here was the opportunity to
drive a good and hard bargain. And what did
it matter, after all? It was only about a girl,
who might any day be taken ill and die; also,
he might have to get her off at a small return
later on if he allowed this chance to slip by.</p>

<p>At last Khaleel spoke, making known the
terms on which his daughter could become the
fourth wife of the unwelcome guest. They were
as follows: a mare, one hundred goats, fifty
sheep, and two hundred silver medjidiehs (each
worth three and fourpence), all to be paid
within three days, with the stipulation that,
should Lulu die before the time for taking her
to her new home, viz., seven days of feasting,
the above payment should become the sole
property of Chief Khaleel, her father. In
addition to the above the new son-in-law was
to give for five successive years one hundred
measures of new wheat and fifty of barley.</p>

<p>The terms were received in silence, and anyone
glancing at the faces of those assembled
could gather that each thought the price high,
but all knew that the visiting chief was rich and
well able to pay the fee demanded, if he chose
to do so.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole day
was spent in arguing, persuasion,
and calculation,
but Sheikh Khaleel was
immovable, the more so
as he saw a chance of
getting his terms.</p>

<p>Finding that talking was
of no avail, Abd-el-Thullam
finally consented to
the terms on condition
that, as soon as the purchase
price was paid, the
seven days of wedding
festivities should commence.
To this Khaleel
gave his consent, and,
although the day was far
spent, the prospective
bridegroom mounted a
horse which had been
brought for him and rode
away, leaving the camel
on which he had arrived
as an earnest of his return. For three days the
camel was tied before the guest-tent, and was
only redeemed just in time to save it from being
forfeited.</p>

<p>We must now leave the guest-tent and for
a time consider some other people who were
keenly interested in the happenings just related.</p>

<p>First, a word about Lulu. As already stated,
she was the only child of her father, and, such
being the case, she was naturally better cared
for and more thought of than if there had been
rivals in the shape of brothers. Her father
spared her in many ways the indignities so
commonly imposed upon females in the East,
one distinction between her and other girls of
the tribe being that her face had not been
tattooed.</p>

<p>At the time of our story her age was about
fourteen. The bloom of youth on her cheek,
with the uprightness of figure so common among
Arab girls, made her queenly in appearance in
spite of her oft-patched flowing robes.</p>

<p>Among her own kith and kin she reigned
supreme, for, having lost her mother soon after
her birth, she had claimed the nursing and
attention of most of the women in the camp;
hence she was ruled by none and spoiled by all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i049.jpg">
<img src="images/i049.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“FOR THREE DAYS THE CAMEL WAS TIED BEFORE THE GUEST-TENT.”<br />
<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Some of the youths, too, had paid her
attention, and, having grown up side by side
with her, were more than mere friends. One,
whose name was Abd-Salaam (the servant of
peace), had even found it in his heart to love
her, which aspiration he knew was not in vain,
for on more than one occasion Lulu had assured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
him that when the time came for her to become
a wife none but the “servant of peace” would
suffice.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that all that had passed
and been settled in the guest-tent between father
and visitor was unknown to either Lulu or her
lover, for the former had been away all day
gathering fuel on the hill-sides in company with
another girl, while Abd-Salaam had gone with
others to a distant town in charge of some
sheep, the day he left the camp being the one
on which the wife-seeker arrived.</p>

<p>It is customary among the Arabs for the girl
who is to be betrothed not to be consulted as
to any likes or dislikes on her part, and she
knows nothing about her being traded off to
some stranger until informed by having the large
outer garment of the suitor thrown around her,
and hearing the announcement that she belongs
to him.</p>

<p>The surprise of Lulu, therefore, on her return
to the camp may be imagined when the scribe
of the community approached her and, all
unawares, covered her with a large camel-hair
<i>abba</i>, saying, “The name of God be with thee,
O Lulu. None shall have thee but Abd-el-Thullam.”</p>

<p>Surprised as she was, she threw off the cloak
and entered the tent, inwardly vowing that none
should have her but the constant companion of
her girlhood. With the liberty allowed her as
the chief’s daughter she went into the guest-tent,
and, with hands clenched and determination
written on her face, informed her father that her
home and lot should not be among strangers,
and that the hated “servant of cruelty” should
be no husband of hers. In this way warfare was
declared, and the probability of trouble in the
near future announced.</p>

<p>That night she was sprinkled with sheep’s
blood, as a sign that her life belonged to another.
Next day she was accompanied by the women
to a spring, and, according to custom, thoroughly
washed and purified, while on the day following
busy fingers worked incessantly making a
wedding-robe for the supposed bride. Lulu
tolerated all these formalities in silence, but
inwardly decided that, do what they would and
act as they might, she would never be the bride
of the one who was to supplant the choice of
long ago.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the third day came round,
but no suitor with the price of the bride had
appeared, and it looked as though Lulu would
be released from her probable marriage, and
her father become the possessor of a camel
for little trouble. Just an hour before sunset,
however, a cloud of dust in the distance told of
the coming of flocks, and ere the golden orb
disappeared altogether Abd-el-Thullam had
handed over what was demanded in return for
his prospective bride. The bleating of the
sheep and the clinking of the silver pieces only
made Lulu vow afresh that no tent of a stranger
should shelter her.</p>

<p>The price having been paid in the presence
of witnesses, the wedding festivities commenced.
The firing of old flint-lock guns was the signal
that announced holiday-keeping for a week.
Sheep were killed, bread baked in abundance,
and coffee-drinking went on continuously. This
is a time much appreciated by the dwellers of
the wilderness, for then they are able to satisfy
the cravings of hunger and for once in a season
eat until satisfied.</p>

<p>Whilst the men raced on their horses or
fought imaginary battles, the women whiled
away the hours in dancing, singing, or sipping
coffee between puffs at their long pipes. So the
days passed, and the end of the marriage feast
approached.</p>

<p>Only Lulu took no part or interest in all that
was going on, and as the men or women
chanted in turn the virtues, praises, and good
fortune of both bride and bridegroom, it all fell
like water on a duck’s back so far as the girl-bride
was concerned. Inwardly she longed for
the return of her boy lover, so that he might
in some way intervene to stop the proceedings,
and so win her for himself according to their
mutual pledge.</p>

<p>But the “servant of peace” did not come,
for the demand in the town for sheep was poor,
and he had to wait many days ere the flock was
disposed of and he free to return to his goats’-hair
home. As time and tide wait for no man,
neither did the last day of the wedding festivities
tarry, and all too soon for the greatly-distressed
Lulu the seventh day dawned, and with it no
visible escape from what seemed her inevitable
fate.</p>

<p>With the constant attention of the women,
escape by flight was well-nigh impossible, but
before noon a probable way of deliverance
presented itself which Lulu was not slow to
grasp. A small company of gipsies arrived at
the camp, one of whom&mdash;an old woman&mdash;professed
a knowledge of drugs, and verified
her statements by producing a small box of
mysterious-looking compounds in powder.</p>

<p>The arrival of the party drew away attention
from Lulu, but she engaged the attention of the
vender of drugs, and elicited from her the fact
that among her wares was poison. It was only
the work of a few minutes to exchange cash for
a mysterious powder, directions for the use of
which were imparted to Lulu in an undertone.</p>

<p>As evening drew on preparations were made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
for the sending away after supper of bride
and bridegroom. The camel that was to carry
Lulu to her new home was decorated and made
ready, and the torches and tom-toms seen to and
handed out to those who were to accompany
the procession on its way to the camp of Abd-el-Thullam.
It seemed that nothing remained to
be done save to partake of supper and start.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“IT WAS ONLY THE WORK OF A FEW MINUTES TO EXCHANGE CASH FOR A
MYSTERIOUS POWDER.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the serving of the unusually large
meal, which occupied the attention of the women
for a time, Lulu slipped out backwards under
the rear curtain
of the tent and
disappeared.
Few missed her
for a time, for
all were busy,
but when the
call was given,
“Bring out the
bride and let
her husband
claim her,” great
was the astonishment,
for no
bride was on
hand. One
abused the
other, and the
angry bridegroom
accused
his host of
treachery and
would have shot
him but for the
interference of
others, who reminded
him
again that Allah
was with the
patient ones.</p>

<p>All denied
that the girl was
dead, for had
they not seen
her alive only a
short time before?
She would
return soon,
they said, and
put an end to
the confusion and mystery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile scouts were
sent out around the camp,
only to return later without
tidings of the fugitive. All
that night watch was kept,
but morning dawned without
the mystery being
solved, and as the day wore on speculations
were indulged in as to whom the purchase price
of Lulu belonged, for, although she had now
disappeared, she on her part had not done
anything within the seven days of the feast to
cause her intended master to claim the price
paid for her. The sun set again without any
light being shed on the disappearance or whereabouts
of the girl-bride, and Abd-el-Thullam
was furious at being balked of his prey, swearing
by every oath available that he would lose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
neither wife nor purchase price, even if the
regaining of one or the other made lifelong
enmity between the two tribes.</p>

<p class="caption">“AN OLD TOMB HEWN IN THE SIDE OF THE CISTERN.”<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>We must now leave the puzzled company in
the guest-tent and see what had become of Lulu.
After slipping under the tent-cloth, she commenced
to run as fast as her bare feet would
permit her. In her excitement and joy at being
free she cared little in which direction she fled,
and although the night was unusually dark, by
reason of heavy storm-clouds, she sped on over
hill and valley until thoroughly tired and exhausted.
As she rested her weary little
frame on the soft herbage of the wilderness
the solitude and stillness made her nervous
and afraid. Her trepidation was not lessened
by a sudden movement near her&mdash;made,
probably, by a jackal more alarmed than
herself.</p>

<p>The fright made her rise quickly and again
take to flight, but after running a few hundred
yards misfortune overtook her, for, without
warning, she tripped and fell headlong into
an old unused cistern quite twenty-five feet
deep. The fall made her unconscious, and
as the pit was far from the camp she was
safe for that night, while a tangle of creepers
and thorns over the mouth of the cavity
made her fairly secure by day.</p>

<p>Here, bruised and unconscious, the poor
little bride-to-be lay until daybreak, when, with
the rising sun, her senses returned to her.
Having considered her surroundings, she
decided to secure herself further by creeping
into an old tomb hewn in the side of the
cistern, where at least she could
die in peace rather than be the
slave of one utterly distasteful to
her. So, with one last fond
thought for her absent lover, she
swallowed the gipsy’s potion and
crawled into the small aperture.
Here she soon fell into a stupor,
caused partly by weariness, but
mainly by the powder bought
from the old drug-vender.</p>

<p>But what had become of the
boy-lover all these days that he
had not returned to the camp
and become conversant with all
that had happened to his little
companion?</p>

<p>As already stated, he was
delayed by a slack market; but
after some days he was free to
return, and, in charge of two
camels, he set out for his wilderness
home. On the day after Lulu’s
escape he was crossing the great
plain, happy at the prospect of reaching camp
before evening. Being somewhat religiously
inclined, he halted at noonday to pray, and soon
after remounting was warned to seek shelter from
a storm that was announced by a sharp crack of
thunder. Looking about him he saw a cavity
in the ground wide and high enough to allow
his camels to enter. By dint of pulling, coaxing,
and beating he forced the beasts in, and at last
all three found themselves in the same pit into
which Lulu had fallen the night before.</p>

<p class="caption">“SUDDENLY HE WAS SEEN TO FALL HEAVILY.”</p>
</div>

<p>The heavy rain dripping through the opening
above made the youth seek better shelter, so he
presently crept into the old tomb, and, to his
amazement, found that it was already occupied
by someone apparently deep in slumber.</p>

<p>Curiosity made him try to rouse the sleeper,
but it was of no use. Crawling farther in, it was
not long before the amazed camel-boy discovered
that the insensible girl was his dearly-loved
Lulu. Assuring himself that she was not dead,
and, of course, ignorant of the circumstances
that had brought her to the cavern, he left her,
and, taking the best of the two camels, rode off
post-haste to carry the news of Lulu’s condition
to the camp and get help.</p>

<p>The announcement
caused a
good deal of talk,
stir, and excitement,
which was
suddenly put a
stop to by Abd-el-Thullam
jumping
on his mare
and making off at
full speed toward
the cavern, hoping
to be the
first to secure his
dearly-bought
bride.</p>

<p>Others joined
in the race, but
it seemed as if
no one would
overtake the
eager chief, when
suddenly he was
seen to fall
heavily, having
been thrown to
the ground by
his mare putting
her foot into a
hole.</p>

<p>He did not
move, and
when the others
reached him they discovered to their consternation
that he had broken his neck and was
quite dead. Instead of a reluctant bride being
escorted to the distant camp, therefore, the corpse
of the unfortunate chief was carried thither.</p>

<p>On reaching the cavern the men found Lulu
still deep in the drug-induced slumber, and,
making a rough litter out of their roomy outer
garments, they carried her to their camp and laid
her on her rude bed of heather and dry grass.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the old gipsy-woman had not left
the camp, and now, taking in the situation, she
administered a dose of some concoction that
soon had the effect of rousing the sleeper and
making her able to explain her presence in the
rock-hewn tomb.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely Lulu regained vigour, and
the old youthful spirit came again, much to the
joy of Abd-Salaam and her father. After a few
weeks another marriage feast was kept, for there
was now no obstacle to the wedding of the lovers,
the price of the bride having been paid by the
ill-fated “servant of cruelty.” The affair was hurried
this time, for the feast was to have a happy ending;
love, instead of custom, had won the day.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I met</span> him at Dalny, in August,
1903&mdash;the year before war broke
out between Japan and Russia.</p>

<p>I had been travelling in Manchuria,
and had come down from
Mukden only just in time to catch, by the skin
of my teeth, the weekly steamer to Japan. The
train was more than an hour late, and the
drosky that I hired at the station&mdash;with my
luggage piled in anyhow by the Chinese porters&mdash;had
been driven by the dishevelled moujik in
charge at a pace that laughed at speed limits
and scorned such trifling obstacles as ruts and
holes nearly a foot in depth.</p>

<p>As we tore up to the steamer’s berth at the
great wharf, that was later to prove of such
inestimable value to the Japanese, the driver
shouting and lashing his three horses into foam,
the gangway was on the point of being lowered,
and I had horrible visions of having to spend a
week in that most dead of dead-alive towns, in
which I already seemed to know every house.</p>

<p>With commendable courtesy, however, the
officials permitted me to get myself and effects
on board, and a moment later we were steaming
out into the fine harbour.</p>

<p>The steamer was the <i>Mongolia</i>, which had
the misfortune six months later to be the first
Russian vessel captured by the Japanese.</p>

<p>I was leaning over the rail, watching the hills
receding from view, when I suddenly felt a tap
on my shoulder, and on looking round was confronted
by a rather sallow-faced, wiry-looking
individual of medium height, with steel-grey
eyes that seemed to pierce through mine clean
into my brain.</p>

<p>“Say, d’you speak English?” he asked me.</p>

<p>I admitted that, being an Englishman, I had
a moderate command of the language.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t English, I’m Amur’can,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“So I see.”</p>

<p>“Well, say now, how’d you know I was
Amur’can?”</p>

<p>“By your accent; one would scarcely
make the mistake of taking you for anything
else.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, you’re smart enough to be an
Amur’can, too, at that rate. Anyhow, I’m
mighty glad to see you, for since I parted with
my friend, who went to Port Arthur, I ain’t had
a chance of hearin’ a language that anyone could
understand. I’m out to beat the record round
the world for the <i>New York</i> &mdash;&mdash;, and if I only
make it in Japan I’ll beat the previous best by
exactly twelve days.”</p>

<p>He then related to me how he had left New
York and travelled <i>vi&acirc;</i> Liverpool, London,
Dover, Ostend, Berlin, Moscow, and the Trans-Siberian
Railway to Dalny; and here he was,
bound for Nagasaki, Japan, where he would
take the train for Yokohama, and thence travel
by the <i>Empress of India</i> to Vancouver, by the
Canadian Pacific Railway to Quebec, and from
there back to New York.</p>

<p>“I’m going to publish a book on the trip, and
I’ve got about enough information to fill it
already. Say, though, my wife’ll be glad to see
me back again in New York. She’s a beautiful
woman, my wife. She’s tall and dark, and has
a straight-front figure&mdash;a woman can’t be
fashionable without a straight-front figure&mdash;and
when she walks she leans forward like a
kangaroo and does the glide. Ever seen it?
I tell you, sir, there’s nuthin’ like it; and it
takes a New York girl to do it properly, and
there ain’t many girls in New York as can lick
my wife at walkin’. I’ll introduce you to her
sometime if I ever see you in New York, an’ if
you don’t say she’s about the slickest thing you
ever saw in skirts, well, you ain’t much of a
judge o’ weather.</p>

<p>“Say, now that I come to look at you, I’ve
seen you before, I guess,” he rattled on.
“Wasn’t you the chap that come rushin’ on to
the platform at Mukden just as our train was
movin’ out of the station?”</p>

<p>I acknowledged that I was. Owing to the
impossibility of obtaining any reliable information
in the town, several miles away, as to
the time of departure of the trains, I had reached
the station, to my great chagrin, just in time to
see the <i>train de luxe</i> move away from the
platform. I had thus been compelled to take
a slow and very dirty train three hours later,
and hence the reason of my nearly missing the
boat at Dalny.</p>

<p>“Looks as if cuttin’ things fine was rather in
your line, eh? Say, though, you couldn’t take
risks like that if you was doin’ a record round
the world. You nearly missed this boat. I
was watchin’ you, and if you’d been on my job
you’d have perspired like a pig as you was
drivin’ up to the wharf, with that woolly-faced
pirate yellin’ and thrashin’ them horses to soapsuds,
and the steamer whistle blowin’ and the
whole durned push hollerin’ and monkeyin’
with the ropes of the gangway. You’d have
had your heart in your boots, young feller, if
you’d been on my lay-out and seen how near
you came to botchin’ up the whole job.</p>

<p>“And talkin’ of botchin’ jobs, if this steamer
doesn’t arrive in Nagasaki in time to catch the
eight o’clock train on Thursday, I’m done.
That train’ll just give me time to catch the
<i>Empress</i> at Yokohama. If I miss it there ain’t
another boat until the <i>Gaelic</i> for San Francisco,
nine days later, and as that’s a slower route I’ll
be fourteen days longer than if I catch the
<i>Empress</i>. Gee whiz, though, it’ll break my wife’s
heart if I don’t clip that twelve days off the
record. She and I figured this whole thing out
together months before I started.</p>

<p>“Now, this boat’s due to arrive at Nagasaki at
eleven o’clock, and if she does no better’n that
there’s no power on earth can help me; the
game’s lost. Guess I’ll have to try and square
the captain to get her into harbour by seven
o’clock. If I can’t do that my wife’ll be heartbroken;
she’s set her heart on this. You ought
to see her; she’s the finest girl in New York&mdash;tall
and slender, with dark eyes and hair, and
she’s got a straight-front figure. But, say, I
guess I’ll have to try and square the captain; I
ain’t a nervous man, but I’m gettin’ nervous
about this.”</p>

<p>With that he took me on one side, where
there was no possibility of any eavesdropping,
and, drawing his watch from his pocket, said,
“You see that watch? How much do you
suppose it’s worth?”</p>

<p>I looked at it closely. It appeared to be a
handsome gold-cased, centre-seconds hunter, but,
after the American fashion, the gold was not hallmarked.
I confessed that I could form no idea
of its value, but it appeared to me to be an
expensive one.</p>

<p>“It’s a most difficult thing for anyone but an
expert to tell the value of a watch, and you
aren’t the only one to think this is somethin’
choice,” said my new acquaintance. “Now
you’ve got a whole lot to learn, and I’m goin’ to
put you up to a tip that’ll save you a pile of
money. There’s not many experts on watches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
to be met with travellin’, and most people would
think this worth fifty dollars at least. That’s
where they’re wrong. I buy these watches by
the dozen, and they only cost me one dollar
and twenty cents each that way. They’re gold-washed,
but they look like solid gold. I always
have one on my chain; it’s no good havin’ it
anywhere else. It must be on the chain you’re
wearin’, and when the time comes for business
you’ve got to tenderly draw it out of your pocket
as if it was somethin’ you valued more than
your life.</p>

<p>“Now, when I started out from Moscow I
bought a second-class ticket, and I got into the
best unoccupied first-class compartment I saw
on the train. After a while the conductor
comes along to examine the tickets. I handed
him mine. He couldn’t speak a word of English,
but he gave me to understand by pretty good
actin’ that I’d have to clear out into the other
end of the train.</p>

<p>“Not bein’ a bad hand at actin’ myself, I was
right <i>in</i> it. I gently pulled my watch from my
pocket&mdash;it was one like this I now have on me&mdash;and
showed him clearly that I intended to
give it to him when we reached Irkutsk if he let
me stay where I was. I repeated the word
Irkutsk several times, each time touchin’ his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Well, sirree, you ought to have been there
to see his face when he caught sight of that
watch! His eyes bulged out of his head so you
could hang your hat on ’em, and to show what
he felt like in his heart he took hold of my hand
and shook it.</p>

<p>“After that he was like a mother to me all
the way. Other compartments were filled up,
but I had mine to myself always. Every time I
passed him I gave him a wink and tapped my
watch-pocket, and he switched on the nicest
smile he kept in stock.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, though, comin’ across Siberia
the inside of that train was hotter’n the gates of
Hades, and every day that feller would come to
my room two or three times to see if he couldn’t
do something to make me more comfortable.</p>

<p>“At Irkutsk I handed over the watch, and
either his joy at receivin’ it or his sorrow at
partin’ with me was so great that he tried to
kiss me.</p>

<p>“Irkutsk is where they change trains, and I
met an Englishman on the platform who lived
in Port Arthur; he was goin’ back there by
way of Dalny. He had been on a holiday to
England, and was comin’ back on third-class
trains, as he had spent about all his money,
and had only just enough to skin through
third-class. When I found he knew the country
and could talk Russian, I invited him to come
along with me; I told him I’d fix things up all
right.</p>

<p>“Well, by and by the conductor comes along,
same as the other had done. There we were,
both in a first-class compartment, one with a
second and the other with a third-class ticket.
I didn’t have need to do any dumb show this
time, for my friend, who spoke the lingo, did all
the gassin’, and told him there was a nice
present waitin’ for him when Dalny was reached
if we could stay where we were, and when I
tenderly took another watch out of my pocket
and looked at it as though it was the only thing
I’d ever loved on earth, he was as much overcome
with joy as number one had been.</p>

<p>“Well, that watch fixed it just as I knew it
would. We both stayed where we were, and
when, at Dalny, I handed it over to the conductor,
I calculated those two watches, worth
two dollars and forty cents, had saved me about
one hundred and twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>“That Englishman was as chock-full of
knowledge about Manchuria as an egg is full of
meat, and I got enough information out of him
to write up the whole trip across Russia and
Siberia.</p>

<p>“Now you see the point I’m gettin’ at.
There’s more of them watches in my bag, besides
this one on my chain, and I’d like to see the
captain of this ship richer by one of ’em, provided
he does somethin’ to earn such a valuable
present as he’ll consider it, until he gets to
pryin’ into the works and askin’ experts’
opinions about it; but by that time I’ll be a
long way off and it ’ain’t likely as I’ll ever
see him again. There’s one disadvantage
about this game that’s worth remarkin’&mdash;you
can’t play it on the same man twice.</p>

<p>“As soon as I came aboard this ship and
found out from the steward the time she gets
to Nagasaki, I saw another watch would have
to go, and that the captain o’ the ship would
be the fortunate possessor. There’s a difficulty
in the way, as he can’t speak English; and I
can’t approach him through the steward, as
that would give the captain away, but I’ve
discovered there’s a Russian lady in the saloon,
whom the captain’s already gettin’ on with like
a house on fire.</p>

<p>“She speaks English with the prettiest accent
you ever heard, and I was talkin’ to her for half
an hour in the harbour before you showed up.
I’ve already told her what I’m doin’, and got her
quite worked up about it, an’ I’ve decided she’s
the one to work the captain for me. There she
is now, comin’ out on deck. Excuse me; there’s
no time to be lost; I’ll get hold of her before the
captain sees her.”</p>

<p>As they walked up and down the deck talking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
animatedly together, I could see my new acquaintance
was making a deeper impression
every minute. Once a few sentences reached
me, and I chuckled inwardly.</p>

<p>“She’ll be broken-hearted if I fail to make it....
I’ll introduce you to her if you come to
New York. She’ll like you and you’ll like her.
She’s tall and dark, with big black eyes, and
she’s got a straight-front figure and a&mdash;&mdash;” I
had to make a guess at the rest, for they had
turned the corner by the wheel-house before the
sentence was finished.</p>

<p>I never doubted what the result of his interview
would be. Already I felt that the arrival
of the <i>Mongolia</i> at Nagasaki by seven o’clock on
Thursday morning was the only thing at present
to live for. I was completely dominated with
enthusiasm for the success of this man’s undertaking,
and felt certain he would as surely win
the Russian lady’s sympathy and co-operation in
his project as he had already secured mine.</p>

<p>After half an hour he came back to me.</p>

<p>“That little woman’s all right. She’s made
o’ good enough clay to be Amur’can, an’ says
she’ll do everythin’ she can to help me. She’s
gone to call the captain now.”</p>

<p>Soon she appeared with the captain, talking in
the most animated manner to him and punctuating
every sentence with most expressive gestures.</p>

<p>Then they came together towards us and she
said, “I haf ze captain told what you say off
your great journey, and he tell me it iss impossible
we come to Nagasaki so early unless
he burn extra fifty tons of coal. Ze captain say
if you pay ze coal he can do it, but if you not
pay ze coal it iss impossible, but ze captain he
like verry much to help you.”</p>

<p>To this my travelling companion made reply,
“Madam, will you please tell the captain that
the cost of the extra fifty tons of coal is but a
trifle, and I’ll do a good deal more than pay for
that. I am so anxious to catch that train that
if the captain will bring the ship into the harbour
by seven o’clock I’ll make him a present
of my watch.”</p>

<p>The lady interpreted this. The captain
shrugged his shoulders, then he looked up at
the funnel, from which great rolling convolutions
of thick black smoke were belching, and he let
his eye run along the line of reek floating lazily
in the cobalt astern for many miles&mdash;almost, it
seemed, to where the yellow, sun-baked Manchurian
hills were disappearing below the
horizon&mdash;his brows knitted in thought.</p>

<p>Before he had finished his cogitations the
would-be breaker of records put his hand into
the left pocket of his waistcoat and drew out
his watch. He carefully removed the chamois
skin bag, soiled sufficiently to show it had long
protected the treasure it covered, and holding
the watch, which looked a perfect beauty as it
caught the sun, in the palm of his hand, he
addressed himself straight to the captain.</p>

<p>“Captain, I <i>must</i> catch that train, and if
you’ll help me to do it, sir, my watch shall be
yours before I leave the ship. Ain’t it a beauty?”
and he held it out for admiration.</p>

<p>All this he said in a manner that carried
conviction with it. The lady interpreted again,
but even that seemed unnecessary. The captain
had capitulated, and from that moment the
result lay in little doubt. The success or failure
of this man’s trip had hung in the balance, and
the issue was decided by a five-shilling watch
glittering in the sun on the deck of a Russian
steamer in the Yellow Sea.</p>

<p>Being in the secret, I could feel only admiration
at the record-breaker’s sang-froid and the
clever and dramatic manner in which he played
his part.</p>

<p>The captain smiled and made a gesture of
deprecation, but his eyes told us that he meant
that watch should be his, and presently he went
below to give directions to the chief engineer.
From that moment the black smoke rolled out
of the funnel thicker than before, hanging over
the steamer’s wake clear to the horizon.</p>

<p>The record-breaker contemplated it and the
unrippled seas with joy.</p>

<p>We went up into the fo’c’s’le, and as we
leaned over the bow and saw the speed at which
the sharp prow was cleaving the glassy water,
sending thin feathers of spray high up along the
steamer’s trim and tapering sides, his enthusiasm
knew no bounds, and his praises of
“God’s country” and his wife became almost
dithyrambic.</p>

<p>All next day, as we steamed past the archipelago
of rocks and barren islands that fringes the
coast of Korea, the sea remained calm as a
pond, and when at half-past six o’clock on
Thursday morning we dropped anchor off the
quarantine station at Nagasaki all doubt seemed
to be at an end. There was some delay, however,
as, though the doctors quickly came on
board, made their examinations, and gave us a
clean bill of health, it takes time to get under
way again, enter the harbour, and take up
a berth amongst the shipping this bustling port
always contains. We anchored at seven-twenty.
The record-breaker knew nothing about the
place, and it is a long way to the station. I
knew it well, however, and, as I felt as keen on
his catching that train as he did himself, I
chartered a <i>sampan</i> and had all our luggage
lowered into it, whilst he went up on to the
bridge to express his thanks and present the
watch to the captain. I saw him take it from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
his pocket and make a little speech as he handed
it over, and I saw the captain bow his thanks.
Then he shook hands, and in another moment
he was beside me and we were being rapidly
pulled to the landing-place, or <i>hatoba</i>.</p>

alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“’AIN’T IT A BEAUTY?’ AND HE HELD IT OUT FOR ADMIRATION.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was not a moment to lose. It was
past seven-thirty, and a good twenty minutes to
the station. Hastily bidding the <i>sampan</i> to
wait with my luggage, I engaged rickshaws and
we were off at full speed. We reached the
station at seven-fifty-five. Having Japanese
money on me I paid the rickshaws, whilst he
bought his ticket with money he had got
exchanged by the steamer’s purser.</p>

<p>He hastily shook hands, thanked me, and got
into the train just one moment before it left.</p>

<p>The watch had <i>really</i> done it, but by actually
less than a minute, and if I had not been there
to help him he would have failed after all. He
promised to write me from Yokohama, but this
he never did. The last I saw of him he was
waving his hat out of the window to me till the
train was out of sight.</p>

<p>The last I heard of him was a few weeks
later, when I read in an American Press telegram
that he had won his spurs and had beaten
the previous best round the world by exactly
twelve days.

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Towards</span> the end of my stay in
Papua my special work was translation,
chiefly of the Scriptures, and
there was a big pile of manuscript
awaiting revision. This was generally
done by one of the mission clergy and myself,
assisted by intelligent natives who possessed a
quick ear for mistakes. The little boy seen in
the first photograph was known as “the Pundit,”
because, although only fourteen years old, he
gave us great assistance in the difficult work of
translation. He had a
wonderful memory, and
was very discriminating
in his choice of words.
He would sometimes
volunteer opinions as to
the style of the sacred
writers, and considered
the Prophet Jeremiah,
on the whole, “easier”
than Isaiah&mdash;in which I
agree with him, so far
as concerns rendering
the books into a native
dialect. Perhaps it was
for this reason that our
youthful “Pundit,” when
he was baptised and
formally discarded his
heathen name of Bonagadona,
chose that of
“Jeremiah,” by which
imposing cognomen he
is now known.</p>

<p>Before long the revision work came to a
standstill, however, for my fellow-reviser had
gone far north to a pioneer station called
Ambasi. It was finally decided that, accompanied
by our mission nurse, I should take the
MSS. to Ambasi and finish the revision there.
So we set out on our long journey up the coast
in the little fourteen-foot schooner. I am not
a good sailor, and I found the journey very
uncomfortable; I was only able to admire
Nature when we anchored.</p>

<p>We spent a very interesting time in Collingwood
Bay, where only two white women had
ever been seen, and that within the year. The
women here wore strips of tappa cloth from
waist to knee, instead of
the grass skirts of the
more eastern tribes, and
the houses were of a
finer and larger type.</p>

<p>The villagers, after
they had got over their
surprise at seeing us,
gave us almost too hearty
a welcome. We were
implored to pull down
our hair, and great was
the astonishment expressed
at the sight when
we did so. They also
failed entirely to understand
our hairpins, hats,
and, above all, our long
noses and small waists!
The Papuans’ methods
of hairdressing, however,
would certainly cause
almost equal astonishment
in civilization.
Look, for instance, at the following photograph,
which depicts the coiffure of a man
belonging to the dreaded Doriri tribe, a people
living inland from Uiaku, whose warlike instincts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
have not yet been subdued.
It will be noticed
that the hair is allowed
to grow long, divided
into plaits, and elaborately
braided until it
looks like a collection of
rope-ends.</p>

<p>At Wanigera, a few
miles away, where a
mission station had been
in existence longer than
at Uiaku, we met with a
quieter reception, though
one old woman, after a
long look at me, asked a
child if I were <i>really</i>
a woman. I wondered
what strange creature
she imagined I was, for
surely, in a white muslin
frock, she could hardly
have taken me for a
man!</p>

<p>During our stay at
Wanigera a great hunt
took place, and some
of the warriors called on
us before setting out.
Their ornaments were
very striking, and the colours almost dazzling.
Altogether they looked a very fine set of men,
and would, no doubt, prove enemies much to
be dreaded in the day of battle. On this
occasion, however, they only waged war with the
brute creation, and they
told us at the close of
the day that the bag was
a very good one.</p>

<p>The interior of the
great church on Sunday
was a fine sight, being
filled with from two to
three hundred natives,
all decked out in feathers,
shell ornaments, gay
tappa cloth, and vivid
flowers. Not less striking
was the almost military
precision with which
each row of worshippers
left the building in turn
at the close of the
service. If these natives
went in for such amenities
of civilization as
church parades, the
spectacle would be a
striking one indeed.</p>

<p>In a neighbouring
village to Wanigera there
is a remarkable tree
house, prepared by the
tribesmen as a place of
refuge from marauding
enemies. From the heights of this arboreal
retreat they were able to hurl down stones upon
the attacking party.</p>

<p>A fine specimen of Papuan womanhood may
be seen in the middle figure of the next photograph
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
reproduced. These women are natives of
Nonof, a village not far from Wanigera. They
were profusely ornamented in order that they
might take part in a dance held after the death
of a chief. It is almost an unheard-of occurrence
for women to don such decorations, which are
regarded as the exclusive property of the men,
and it looks as though the ladies were beginning
to agitate for equal privileges in the way of
finery with their lords and masters. A native,
on being shown my collection of curios, which
included some ornaments, remarked that I was
<i>me oroto</i>, or “like a man,” because of my many
possessions.</p>

[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>The natives of Papua are very much addicted
to betel-chewing. Areca palms are plentiful up
the coast, but pepper-leaf and lime are required
as well. The lime&mdash;which in some districts is
prepared from coal&mdash;is obtained in Collingwood
Bay by burning shells. The above photograph
well illustrates the primitive process in use for
slaking the lime after the burning of the shells.
The lime is then stored, and ladled out from a
calabash when required.</p>

<p>Our stay at Wanigera having come to an end,
we embarked once more on the little schooner
and set off again. We anchored each night, for
the native captain was not very certain of his
bearings, and reefs were plentiful. On the third
day after leaving Wanigera, however, he was
either influenced by the crew or had a sudden
impulse of recklessness, for after the sun had
set he tried, in the uncertain light, to bring the
boat into harbour on a particularly reef-bound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
part of the coast. There was a strong wind
blowing, and the waves were slapping angrily
against the sides of the vessel, when suddenly,
without a moment’s warning, there was a grating
shock, and we realized that we had struck a reef.
It was almost dark by now, and the lights of the
settlement could be seen two or three miles
away.</p>

<p>The captain let go the anchor at once, but the
boat began to roll so violently that we felt doubtful
as to whether the cable would stand the strain.
Meanwhile the boys scrambled into the dinghy
and rowed around to investigate our position.
Strange though it may seem, no harm appeared
to have been done to the boat, but we were so
surrounded by reefs that we did not dare to
move from where we were anchored. So there
we pitched and rolled about all night, though
the strength of the wind abated later on.
What with one thing and another, I felt like a
very frightened tennis-ball, and I was extremely
thankful when, at sunrise, we were able to make
for the shore, where we spent the day and night
at the house of a friendly magistrate.</p>

<p>We were now only thirty or forty miles from
our destination, and the next afternoon arrived
at Ambasi. No white women had ever been
there before, and for many days we were visited
by parties of natives, all eager to see the strange
white ladies. Women carrying their babies
astride on their shoulders, old men leading little
boys, and married couples, with or without their
families, would pay us long visits, wanting to
know what a sewing-machine was, to look at our
bedrooms, and, above all, to taste our food.
The nurse had her hands full soon after she
arrived, for the people had great faith in her
remedies, and patients presented themselves in
shoals for treatment. Her pet patients appeared
to be old men, who became frightfully jealous of
one another if she appeared to devote more
attention to one than another. They would
glare fiercely at the patient who was being
rubbed or otherwise treated, and were only
partly mollified when their own turn came.</p>

<p>During our stay at Ambasi we dispensed with
such luxuries as mirrors and sheets, and rolled
ourselves in blankets, to sleep contentedly in
hammocks slung on the veranda. We could
not, however, do without mosquito nets, for
without them rest would have been quite
impossible. At night we were surrounded by
the pale sparks of fireflies, and far below, on the
beach, the natives’ flaring torches would flicker
for hours as they fished, standing patiently in
the sea. In the early morning the sweet notes
of a bird would wake us from some lofty
tree at the edge of the thick forest close by,
behind which rose in majesty the great Owen
Stanley range, standing out distinctly in the
clear morning air. The highest peak, Mount
Albert Edward, over thirteen thousand feet
high, had not long before been ascended for
the first time by a magistrate and one of the
mission staff.</p>

<p>We could not always keep dry under our
roof, which allowed the rain to penetrate it in
many places. One memorable night I piled
nearly all my belongings in a heap covered by a
mat, and at last sought shelter from the prevailing
showers under the table, which was, I am
glad to say, rainproof. But it would not have
done to be without rain, for it was our only
water supply, the spring on the beach being too
brackish to drink.</p>

<p>The Ope, a small river, was only three miles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
distant, within easy reach of the station by boat
or beach. I visited it one Sunday morning,
taking with me a village boy who knew a little
broken English. It was a glorious walk on the
hard yellow sand, for the tide was out, but the
return journey was most fatiguing, for the waves
had covered the firm portion, and at each step I
sank ankle-deep in the yielding sand.</p>

<p>When we reached the Ope no canoes were to
be seen, except on the farther bank. We called
and beckoned, and after a time a small boy
brought one over to us, on which we embarked.
There were no paddles, a very slender stick
being our only means of propelling it, and we
naturally made poor progress. Our little ferry-man,
however, was not disconcerted. Kneeling
down and putting his right leg overboard he
obligingly paddled with that, and most successfully.</p>

<p>It was at the place to which I was going that
the launch had once been wrecked, and where,
some years before, the Bishop of New Guinea
and one of his laymen had spent the night in
peril of their lives, after escaping from drowning
and from a shark. It was with some anxiety,
therefore, that I looked forward to our arrival.</p>

<p>I am bound to say, however, that no one
could now accuse the villagers of evil designs
on us, for I was presented with a young coconut
to drink, and saw nothing amiss in the
behaviour of the natives, unless a request to
take down my hair can be regarded as such.</p>

<p>A chief had died the week before, and the
dead man seemed to have been related to the
majority of the people, for many were daubed
with light yellow clay, which is their form of
mourning. The widow herself was seated on
her husband’s grave, which was situated <i>inside</i>
the house. There, according to tribal etiquette,
she must remain until she had finished making
her mourning jacket of netted string trimmed
with “Job’s tears.” I was glad the poor thing
had something to occupy her mind, for the
horror of the situation was increased by the
presence of two old crones who, one on each
side of her, wailed incessantly.</p>

<p>Burial in the house in more settled parts of
Papua has been forbidden by the Government,
and where the missions are located graveyards
have been set aside and fenced in.</p>

<p>When my work at Ambasi was over the little
schooner arrived once more to take us back. It
was now the calm season, and our progress was
decidedly slow. The little cabin below, where
the nurse and I slept, was stuffy in the extreme,
and it was delightful to get on deck in the early
morning, though I was seldom able to do more
than lie there with a bit of sail or a blanket
stretched above to keep off the rays of the sun.
Then it would become unbearably hot, and I
would retreat to the airless cabin once more
until the cool of the evening approached. All
day long the sails flapped aimlessly and the
blocks thudded loudly on the deck, for the
breeze was usually too light to help us. Towards
evening a wind sprang up, but too late to enable
us to make for an anchorage among the reefs in
the treacherous half-light. Matters improved as
we got farther down the coast, however, and
though on the last day we saw a waterspout in
the distance we met with no mishaps, and
finally reached our journey’s end in safety.</p>

<p>Though there are marked differences in the
Papuans themselves, as well as in their dwellings
and languages, the time will come, no doubt,
when, under the influence of the white man,
they will abandon their primitive Stone Age
ways for twentieth-century ones. Then,
probably, much of their charm will vanish.
They may reap many benefits, but, as with so
many other savage races, it is more than likely
that the change will not be altogether to their
advantage. At any rate, I am glad that I have
lived with them and known them at home,
while they are still unspoiled children of
Nature.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> time after my arrival at Teniet-el-Haad
my husband and I, together
with our first lieutenant and his wife,
were invited to a “diffa” given in
our honour by a Caid named Si

<p>He most politely sent his wagonette to fetch
us and was at the door of his house to receive
us. He was a tall, good-looking man, and his
costume was exquisite. His <i>serronal</i>, or wide
trousers, were of pale-grey satin cloth, the large
pockets on each side richly embroidered in silk
braid of the same shade. Silver lace covered
his short bolero, which opened over a shirt
which was a mass of green and red silk, gold
and silver embroidery. Over that again he
wore a lovely white silk “haik,” which, covering
his head-dress and kept in place by the “camel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
cords,” fell round his shoulders, and was then
caught up in front from the knee to the gold
waistbelt by a cerise coloured silk handkerchief.
Over his shoulders hung his burnous, the outer
one of fine grey cloth to match the costume,
handsomely embroidered at the corners and
round the hood, the under one of fine white
flannel.</p>

<p>He led us majestically
into his “drawing-room”&mdash;which,
alas! bore unmistakable
traces of the
Caid’s various journeys
to Paris. There was
nothing Arab but the
lovely carpets and the
smell.</p>

<p>A rickety Louis XV.
<i>canap&eacute;</i>, with chairs to
match, stood stiffly
against the walls; their
coverings of chintz
badly wanted washing.
An oval table, a walnutwood
wardrobe, a
washing-stand without
the accessories, and
two big mirrors, whose
frames had once been
gilded, completed the
furniture. We here
partook of refreshments
in the unromantic
shape of absinthe
and lemonade, accompanied
by Huntley and
Palmer’s biscuits and
wafers. I was much
disappointed, for I had
hoped to see something
more Arab and
to eat and drink according
to the customs
of the land. I supposed
this was “progress”
in Benrajah’s
idea; at any rate, he
looked most satisfied
with himself and his
surroundings. He introduced
another Caid to us&mdash;the Caid of
Biskra, I think, who was passing through&mdash;a
fine, handsome man, whose photograph is here
reproduced.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CAID OF BISKRA.<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>We breakfasted in a large tent, as Benrajah
said it was still too warm in the house. Remembering
the close, “camelly” sort of smell, I quite
agreed with him.</p>

<p>As we entered the tent Mme. G&mdash;&mdash;, the
lieutenant’s wife, whispered to me, “Now, mind
you don’t refuse a single dish the Caid offers
you. If you do you will mortally offend him,
especially as it is the first time you break bread
under his roof, and the ‘diffa’ is in your honour.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered, cheerily.</p>

<p>“Bon! bon! bon!”
she cried. “Don’t
forget, you <i>must</i> eat
everything he offers
you.” She skipped off
roaring with laughter,
which, at the time, I
thought very silly of
her.</p>

<p>I was again very disappointed
by the civilized,
European way in
which we ate. Instead
of squatting
cross-legged on the
ground, eating with
brotherly love out of
the same dish with a
wooden spoon or our
fingers, we sat round a
well-laid table, with
knives and forks, and
dinner-napkins embroidered
with the
Caid’s initials. Everyone
and everything is
getting so horribly civilized
nowadays, I reflected,
sadly.</p>

<p>The repast began
with a red-hot liquid
in which vermicelli
floated. It burnt my
unaccustomed mouth
and I did not fall in
love with it, but as I
had never tasted anything
like it before I
did not even want to
refuse when the Caid
offered me a second
helping. After the
soup came some boiled
chicken, on which the
red liquid had been poured. He helped me
largely&mdash;twice. The third course was mutton,
with prunes; the fourth mutton, with red
liquid; the fifth a French <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, with an Arab
taste; the sixth was chicken without the red
liquid; the seventh an Irish stew gone wrong;
the eighth&mdash;well, perhaps my readers are
beginning to feel as tired as I did after having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
partaken twice of all these dishes. Indeed, I
was beginning to feel very serious, and longed
ardently for the end of this Gargantuan repast.</p>

<p>After about the twelfth course an Arab in
waiting cleared a space on the table before the
Caid. My hopes were raised to the heights,
but, alas! only to fall to the lowest depths in a
very short space of time. Suddenly something
knocked my hat on one side, and everyone
yelled at me. Dazed, I looked round and
rubbed my nose into a sheep’s leg. Starting
back, I met the convulsed and, as I imagined,
reproachful eye of an enormous sheep lying in
a contorted attitude on a big brass platter.
Si Benrajah
turned to me with
a gracious smile.
“I am much
honoured, madam,”
he said, in
perfect French,
“in being the
first to offer you
a ‘meshui’ on
your arrival in
Algeria.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i066.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">A TYPICAL ARAB HUT.<br />
[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>A “meshui,” I
learnt, is a royal
dish, and is only
offered to those
the Arabs delight
(or are compelled)
to honour.
It is simply a
whole sheep
roasted over
wood embers,
and served uncut
on a brass or
silver platter. It
should not be cut
with a knife, but
torn off with the
fingers and eaten.
If you wish to be
particularly polite to a friend who is present,
you wrench off a piece of flesh and present it
with your greasy fingers, and he receives it
much flattered, returning the compliment with
<i>his</i> greasy fingers. This style of eating was
certainly not over-civilized, so I ought to have
been better pleased than I was. As a matter
of fact I felt very bad, and hoped against hope
that the Caid would forget me.</p>

<p>“You are not yet accustomed to our habits,”
he said, kindly. “Take a knife and fork and
cut off the meat.”</p>

<p>So I cut off a few small bits in a dilatory way,
secretly wondering if I could not surreptitiously
throw them to some lean, hungry dogs who were
peering into the tent door.</p>

<p>“What silly little bits!” cried Benrajah,
laughingly. Then, after well licking his brown,
henna-stained fingers, he tore off a huge piece
and offered it to me! A cold perspiration broke
out on my forehead, and I almost longed for
death.</p>

<p>“Eat! eat!” he cried, gaily; and, choking
down my despair, I ate.</p>

<p>How could I dare to do otherwise after
Mme. G&mdash;&mdash;’s warning? Are not the laws
of hospitality sacred and to be observed
throughout the world? But it was terrible
tribute to pay to
foreign customs,
and I felt a lesser
desire for originality.</p>

<p>“It is good?”
inquired the Caid.</p>

<p>“Delicious!
delicious!” I
answered, with a
ghastly green
smile.</p>

<p>“Ah! Here
is a <i>comme il faut
Roumia</i>!” he
cried, enchanted&mdash;and
promptly
tore me off a
beautiful brown
piece of meat,
weighing, I should
think, about three
pounds! My cup
of anguish was
full, and I prayed&mdash;yes,
actually
prayed&mdash;to be
delivered from
that three pounds
of meat.</p>

<p>And I was.</p>

<p>Crash! The table-cloth was half dragged off,
and, amid a rain of knives and forks, plates and
glasses, my little girl rolled on to the ground.
I did not lose my presence of mind, but, seizing
my pounds of meat, all unseen in the commotion
I threw them to the lean dogs, who made very
short work of them. Then my motherly feelings
came to the fore, and I went to the rescue of my
child. It was soon apparent what had happened&mdash;the
poor mite had been given too much
wine by the thoughtless Mme. G&mdash;&mdash;, and
was very seedy for some days afterwards.</p>

<p>It would be reasonable to suppose that the
“meshui” was the last of the courses, but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
disappeared only to give place to the Arab
national dish, the “couscous.” At sight of the
snowy pile of rolled semolina, surmounted by
more mutton, a feeling of revolt took possession
of me. I felt I could dare Lucifer himself;
and so I refused the couscous, although in a
cowardly way, by pretending that fresh air was
necessary for my poor little Ren&eacute;e. Perhaps it
was, but if it had not been I should have said
the same.</p>

<p>I do not think I ever quite forgave Mme.
G&mdash;&mdash; her two practical jokes, for practical
jokes they were. When I described my sufferings
at having to eat all the Caid gave me, she
laughed herself ill and said, “What a ‘blue’ you
are!” Which is the French military way of
calling you a greenhorn.</p>

<p class="caption">“I LOOKED ROUND JUST IN TIME TO SEE AN ARAB LOWERING HIS GUN.”</p>
</div>

<p>One of my husband’s great amusements in
this out-of-the-way garrison was to construct a
hiding-place, in front of which he fixed the
carcass of some dead animal, and there, gun in
hand, to await the wild beasts such as hyenas,
jackals, lynxes, and golden foxes, who scented
from afar the goodly supper awaiting them.
On these occasions they generally found too
much pepper, and often suffered from a mortal
indigestion. I sometimes accompanied my
husband on such expeditions, and greatly
enjoyed crouching silently in some hidden
corner, listening to the wailing of an approaching
hyena, or the querulous squabbling and
howling of the shrieking jackals. And then,
when the dry sticks cracked and the dead leaves
rustled quite close to me under their stealthy
pads, my heart would leap into my mouth for
fear they should mistake <i>me</i> for their supper.
One night whilst thus listening to some
approaching creature my husband, crouching
about twenty yards from me, suddenly rose
up and called out in Arabic, “Who goes
there?” I looked round just in time to see an
Arab huntsman lowering his gun, which was
pointed full at <i>me</i>. He thought I was a hyena!</p>

<p>During the winter, when the snow lay thick
on the ground, I preferred staying at home to
keep up a huge fire and fabricate hot drinks in
readiness for the frozen huntsman’s return; it
seemed to me more a wife’s duty!</p>

<p>Another short incident of my life in Teniet-el-Haad
may not be uninteresting. My husband
had gone to the manœuvres with his Spahis, and
our <i>bordj</i> was only guarded by about thirty
“Tirailleurs Algerians.” Then, one day, a
terrific storm burst over the land. The air
was so thick with fine sand that I could not
distinguish the trees before my windows, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
sun hung in the sky like a lurid orange ball,
seemingly about to drop. The heat was stifling;
one gasped for breath, and, although every door
and window was hermetically closed, the rooms
were full of sand.</p>

<p>Presently a terrible clamour arose from the
village&mdash;shouts, cries, screams, gun-shots. Then
from the <i>bordj</i> courtyard I heard sharp orders
given, the clanking of weapons, and finally the
sound of a body of infantry running. The wind
howled and shrieked, the sand-storm grew
denser and denser, and still the clamour continued
in the village. I sat in the drawing-room
with my little ones around me, wondering if it
were a serious revolt, and what would happen to
us if it were. For the district of Teniet-el-Haad
was a large one, containing thirty thousand
Arabs, and we were far from any important
garrison, while our protectors, all Arab, consisted
of thirty “tirailleurs,” and ten Spahis
belonging to the “Commune Mixte.” Pensively
I placed my revolver close to my hand,
and waited anxiously.</p>

<p>After a few hours the sirocco cleared somewhat,
the noise ceased, and the tirailleurs
returned. The whole affair, they told me, had
been got up by the mountain Arabs against the
Jews, who had been “doing” them. So the
Arabs had taken the law into their own hands
and administered justice by repaying themselves
a hundred-fold and making off with their booty
up the mountains, well hidden by the sand-storm.
In the scuffle a boy and two men were
killed, all Jews&mdash;so it did not matter, so the
folks said.</p>

<p>My husband was second captain at Teniet-el-Haad,
having given up his rank as first captain
in the Hussars in order to facilitate his return to
a regiment. He was therefore the oldest in
grade in the 1st Spahis, and the earliest vacancy
as first captain fell to him. We had been at
Teniet about ten months when he received
orders to take command of the Laghouat
squadron. It was the beginning of February;
snow lay thick and deep on the ground up in
this high altitude, and the great question arose
how we were to get to Laghouat. Should we
take the short cut by carriage across the mountains
to Boghar, where the regimental brake
would meet us and take us on, or go down to
Affreville by the rickety diligence, train to
Medeah, and continue by carriage?</p>

<p>Going by train was a difficulty and an extra
expense on account of our dogs. We had four&mdash;three
fox-terriers and a shooting dog. I do
not know what he called himself, but he had a
double-barrelled nose and an over-frank and
exuberant nature. He and Charleston, the old
fox, could not bear each other. It was quite
impossible to put them together in the dog-box,
and to pack them separately would have cost as
much as four times as many children. So, in
consideration of their feelings and our purse, we
decided&mdash;oh, irony!&mdash;to take the short cut if
the snow and slush would allow of a carriage
travelling along the narrow mountain tracks.</p>

<p>We consulted the different French and native
authorities, and finally decided, if the snow and
slush would allow, to take the short cut over
the mountains. We started off one fine
morning at five, in a small brake lent by a Caid,
who also promised to send us four strong mules
to an inn some twenty miles off. The first
twenty miles were soon done, and at half-past
seven we were enjoying some good hot coffee,
whilst our Spahi was unharnessing his team and
making inquiries as to the whereabouts of the
new relay and coachman. Ten minutes after
he appeared, with a very concerned face. “Mon
capitaine, Sidi Belgacun has sent two mules no
bigger than donkeys, and the boy who drives
them is a mere baby!”</p>

<p>This sounded cheerful, and with one accord
we went out to inspect. The Spahi’s account was
unfortunately but slightly exaggerated, and we
stood staring at our tiny steeds with dismay. We
had still fifty kilometres before us, and the roads
for at least twenty-five were nothing but cross-country
paths. Should we turn back, or try to
find other horses and go on? I voted emphatically
for going on. Aided by the Spahi,
my husband finally unearthed a man and two
horses, and at eight o’clock we set off once
more.</p>

<p>Everything again went well for ten kilometres;
then our misfortunes really began. When going
up a hill the ground grew soft and the wheels
of the brake sank in.</p>

<p>“The snow is melting farther on,” remarked
the coachman, laconically; “the underground
springs are overflowing.”</p>

<p>On we went laboriously, our Jehu yelling at
the struggling horses, whilst the carriage wobbled
to and fro in a most alarming fashion. “Don’t
you think it would do us good to walk a bit?”
I suggested. “It would make things easier for
the horses.”</p>

<p>“It would be safer,” said my husband, who
was looking anxious.</p>

<p>So out we got&mdash;and two minutes later the
whole concern toppled over, our boxes, portmanteaux,
and packets flying all over the place.
The horses were plunging and kicking; the
coachman, an Italian, and the Arab boy
were yelling and swearing in their respective
languages, whilst my husband <i>exclaimed</i> in
French (he doesn’t swear, but I am sure he
would have liked to on this occasion). The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
scene was so unutterably comic that I could not
help myself; I laughed until the tears rolled
down my cheeks. I draw a curtain over the
face my better half turned on me&mdash;scowling was
not in it&mdash;and although I assured him I was
really quite as upset as the carriage he has not
recovered from my frivolity to this day.</p>

<p>The men picked up the carriage and the
baggage and put all in order and we thought we
should get on again, but, alas! the wheels refused
to move an inch; the more we tried the deeper
they sank. After two hours of vain endeavour,
Peppino, the coachman, suggested sending Ali
to have a look round the country to see if he
could find a village and get men with spades
to come and dig us out. The boy set off,
returning later with five stalwart men, who
comparatively soon dug us out and accompanied
us for a few kilometres on our way,
pushing and yelling when necessary. Then
they left us, saying the road was good right up
to Boghar. It was now past two o’clock, and
our lunch loomed very dimly in the far distance,
having been ordered for twelve o’clock at Boghar.</p>

<p>About three o’clock we saw snow on the side
of the road, which again grew slushy and soft.
My husband and Peppino were obliged to run
behind, pushing at the wheels at the difficult
places, whilst the Arab boy cheered on his mules
and Peppino’s horses.</p>

<p>The snow got deeper and deeper. Presently
we passed a carriage abandoned on the side of
the road, farther on a dead horse, and again a
form, which looked terribly human, covered by
a white pall.</p>

<p>After a while we came to a wider part. On
the right was a sloping mountain-side half
covered with snow, half with golden narcissus,
and showing a dry watercourse, dotted about with
huge stones. On the left was a smooth field
of snow, across which wheel marks could be
distinguished. “We must cross here,” said
Peppino, “as someone has before us; the snow
is doubtless hard, and by whipping up the horses
I will get you over. The road is impossible.”</p>

<p>My husband was not of the same opinion.
He considered the watercourse a better road
than a snow-field, and the presence of stones
made him surmise that the bottom was hard.</p>

<p>The matter was hotly discussed, but finally
my husband gave in, seeing that Peppino knew
the road and he did not.</p>

<p>Away we galloped&mdash;bump, bump, bump.
Then, without warning, there came a tremendous
crack, and, lo and behold! there we were, sitting
in our carriage, whilst the horses and Peppino
continued with the wheels! It was, of course,
a terrible dilemma, but again I had to laugh; it
was really too funny.</p>

<p>My husband and Peppino carried me and the
children and perched each of us on a stone,
where I stood on one leg and cawed like a crow.
“One should always take misfortunes gaily,”
I said. That was the last straw; my better half
had to laugh, but the smile was rather sickly.
Then we held a council of war.</p>

<p>Peppino, good man, saved the situation.
“I will go back with the horses and fetch the
carriage we saw abandoned at the side of the
road,” he said. “I know the owner, and will
take the responsibility for borrowing it on my
own shoulders.”</p>

<p>So off he went, whilst we cawed to one
another from stone to stone and ate snow,
there being nothing else to do. Before long
Peppino returned triumphantly with the borrowed
carriage, the luggage was transferred, and we
started off again, leaving our first equipage
standing disconsolately in the snow.</p>

<p>All went well until eight o’clock, although my
husband and Peppino had constantly to push at
the wheels. They both looked ten years older
than at the start, so lined and weary were their
faces. At about eight we came to a narrow
track, a real road winding round the mountain
above a fathomless precipice. On each side
the snow lay in drifts of five and six feet deep,
and the centre track showed no sign of previous
passage.</p>

<p>We had not gone fifty yards along this road
when the horses stopped and the wheels disappeared
in a drift. Yelling, pushing, and pulling
had no effect whatever. The horses were then
harnessed to the splash-board, but their strenuous
efforts only resulted in tearing it from the body
of the carriage.</p>

<p>All this time I was sitting in the snow trying
to keep the little one warm, and hopefully
encouraging the two elder ones, Charlie and
Ren&eacute;e. From the mountain top came the discordant
howling and barking of jackals; from
the blackness below arose the sad wailing of a
hyena. I very nearly became tearful.</p>

<p>Peppino again offered his services, and proposed
riding off to fetch help at a sheikh’s some
ten miles away.</p>

<p>“Get into the carriage, wrap yourselves up
warmly with everything available, and wait,” he
said. “In five or six hours I will bring assistance.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to be done, so we
made the best of a bad job, packed ourselves
up, and tried to sleep. The children, of course,
succeeded at once, as did my husband, worn
out with the efforts of the day, but I could not.
My hunger was great, and I do not think I have
ever before or since imagined such cold. Talk
of African heat; African <i>cold</i> has the first place
in my memory.

<p class="caption">“I KICKED VIGOROUSLY, SHOUTING ‘HENRI!’ AND ‘PEPPINO!’”</p>
</div>

<p>The night was pitch-dark, and it was far from
amusing to sit there listening to the animals
prowling round. A hyena or so came very near
to our mules, who shivered and snorted for a
long time after.</p>

<p>Numbed with cold, I suppose I at last fell
asleep. Suddenly I was awakened by a great
commotion. Then came yelling, the sound of
horses plunging, and I heard the children
shrieking “Mother!” I rose precipitately, a
light flashed in my face, baby was seized from
me, and I myself was borne off like an infant
by a man who appeared to be a giant. He
hurried away up the mountain-side without a
word, which did not at all seem to me the right
behaviour of rescuers. Why thus seize us and
bear us off into the mountains?</p>

<p>We must have been attacked by brigands, and
my husband knifed as he slept! I kicked
vigorously, shouting “Henri!” and “Peppino!”
but received no answer, and my heart sank. Then
I called “Charlie!” “Ren&eacute;e!” and to my great
joy their voices answered quite close behind me.
I therefore left off kicking&mdash;which, indeed, had
no effect on my burly captor&mdash;and consoled
myself with the thought that, though apparently
a widow, I was not left childless.</p>

<p>After five minutes or so my giant began to
shout. Other voices answered; then suddenly
I was planted on my feet in the inky darkness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
but almost at once a dozen matches were struck
and held to a huge heap of dry brushwood. In
two seconds we had a royal bonfire, which not
only warmed us but lit up the country all round.</p>

<p>Brigands or no brigands, I thought, these
Arabs were very thoughtful fellows.</p>

<p>I asked several times, “Where is my husband?”
but they all raised their hands and
shoulders in vague denial of any knowledge of
his existence. I
was beginning to
be really alarmed
when his welcome
form loomed in
view astride a mule.
I do not think we
have ever quite
understood how he
came to miss us in
the confusion
caused by the headlong
arrival of our
rescuers. He had
galloped after us
along a road where
we had not been at
all; but, not finding
us, had come
back, and had been
guided by the firelight.</p>

<p>After a good
warming at the fire
we started for the
sheikh’s house, ten
miles off, the children
being carried
by Arabs on horseback,
and I astride
a mule on a “barda.”
On our arrival we
found couscous and
sour milk awaiting
us, and&mdash;what was
far better&mdash;some good mattresses spread on the
ground in a big, white-washed room. At ten
next morning we left, the kindly sheikh having
lent us his wagonette. Peppino had gone back
with some Arabs to dig out and bring along
Carriage Number Two.</p>

<p>About half-way to Boghar we met the
regimental brake coming spanking along. The
soldier driving told us that at eight o’clock an
Arab had come to him saying that he was to
harness up at once and drive for eight miles
along the Teniet road, when he would find the
Spahis’ captain, who was stranded with his
family at Sheikh ben Shinan’s.</p>

<p>This experience of Arab telegraphy rather
astonished us, for we were still greenhorns in
this respect. Since then nothing of the kind
surprises us; I have often learnt of distant
happenings from the Arabs long before our own
civilized methods brought me the news. Arabs
travel a great deal
by night, passing
on the tidings from
one to another&mdash;they
are terrible
gossips&mdash;so that it
is the case of the
hare and the tortoise.
Their signalling
is done by
movements of the
burnous by day and
fires by night. In
each district certain
heights are especially
used for this
purpose. Whilst
travelling by road
on one occasion I
remember hearing
a long hoot-like call,
and on looking in
the direction of the
sound I saw an Arab
on a hill, evidently
signalling with his
burnous, for he was
making regular up-and-down
and to-and-fro
movements
with it. Half an hour
after we saw another
Arab with a huge
flock of sheep. In
the evening, when
we arrived at the place we meant to camp at, we
found ourselves expected by the sheikh, and a
hospitable couscous prepared. He bade us
welcome, saying we were later than he had
thought. When we inquired how it was he expected
us at all, he only vouchsafed to say, with half-closed
eyes, that he had known we were on the
road some hours before, and had supposed we
would stop the night there. Thereupon we remembered
the white-robed Arab on the hill and
the shepherd far away, and began to understand.</p>

<p>Having reached the
town of Wilson, in the
southern part of the
territory, I fell in with two fellow-commercial
salesmen&mdash;Levy, representing a large dry-goods
concern, and Bates, handling a line of boots for
a St. Louis house.</p>

<p>Levy imparted the fact that he was going to
visit a large mining camp, called World City,
located some hundred and sixty miles to the
north and as many miles distant from the railway.
Bates said he would join Levy provided
I would make one of the party.</p>

<p>Although my route did not include this side-trip,
I became convinced that it would pay me
well to visit World City. By sharing expenses
with Levy and Bates, the
trip could be made most
reasonably, so I wired
my house accordingly,
and Levy hastened to
make arrangements
with a local celebrity,
a Scotchman named
McGill, for transportation.</p>

<p>An agreement having
been made with McGill,
the balance of the day
was consumed in making
preparations for our
departure on the following
morning. There
were blankets to buy,
for one is never safe
without them. No
matter how hot and
burning the day may
be, the nights are always
crisp and chill on the
Arizona plains, and one
never knows while making
such a trip when he
will land at his destination.
Nine chances out
of ten he will be hours
late. Our journey was
no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was aroused by
McGill. On the wagon, which was a heavy
four-wheel affair, he had loaded three shoe-sample
trunks, the property of Bates, and two
immense square trunks carried by Levy. Beside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
this there were sundry boxes and bundles of
blankets, as well as our heavy overcoats and
small personal luggage.</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast of ham and eggs&mdash;I
generally ordered ham and eggs in Arizona
because other meats were far from tender in
those days&mdash;we took our places on the wagon.
Levy occupied the front seat with McGill, while
Bates and I sat on top of a huge trunk, slippery
and uncertain.</p>

<p>Although the animals seemed good and hardy,
they were small, and I do not think we realized
the great weight of the combined load. At the
wheels we had a pair of small and nimble mules,
and as leaders a pair of small bay horses, whose
looks did not recommend them.</p>

<p>The first day out all went well, and we reached
the little town of Bonita, a most desolate-looking
place. We had travelled less than thirty miles.</p>

<p>We drove up to the door of a little adobe
building with a thatched roof. On the front a
crude sign informed the public that it was a
“General Store.” Another placard indicated
that it was also a public-house, or “saloon,” as
they are called in America.</p>

<p>On entering we found ourselves in a small
room with a rough counter running down one
side, behind which was the smiling face of the
proprietor, who lived with his wife and two
beautiful daughters in the one adjoining room&mdash;these
two rooms constituting the entire building.</p>

<p>We spent the night on the floor of the store,
in front of the counter, and next morning
resumed our journey, hoping to reach the little
group of buildings known as Standard before
night. In my own mind&mdash;and I think the
others believed the same&mdash;I did not really
expect to reach Standard that night, for it was
nearly fifty miles distant and our animals were
far from fresh.</p>

<p>I think it was about ten o’clock in the morning
that we saw a cloud of dust several miles ahead.
In time it proved to be a company of negro
soldiers, marching to a neighbouring military
post.</p>

<p>As they came alongside we could see a
number of rifles sticking out of the canvas of
the great covered wagons which accompanied
them. They halted, and an officer, whom
McGill said was a colonel, came over. He
saluted us pleasantly and asked laughingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you not afraid to travel in this direction?”</p>

<p>McGill inquired why, whereupon the officer
explained that “Apache Kid” was out with a
small band of warriors, that Geronimo had
disappeared from the Indian Reservation, and
that serious trouble was brewing. The troops,
he added, were being moved for the purpose of
heading off “Apache Kid” and his crowd.</p>

<p>The smiling face of the colonel rather misled
me. He did not seem really serious, and, as I
sized up the situation, I believed it quite possible
that he recognised our party as “tenderfeet,”
and desired to frighten us.</p>

<p>After the soldiers had become a mere blur in
the distance we resumed our journey. We had
gone but a few miles farther, however, when an
accident occurred to our wagon. Something
gave way&mdash;I don’t remember what&mdash;and it
became impossible to proceed. Levy took a
look at the wagon and declared it was “no good,
anyway”; Bates joined in the abuse, and McGill
lost his temper. Finally, I acted as peacemaker,
and suggested that something would have to be
done as the afternoon was advancing. Either
we must return to Bonita on foot, abandoning the
wagon and contents, or McGill would have to
take the team back and secure another conveyance.</p>

<p>The last alternative being accepted, we drew
lots, and it fell to Levy to return to Bonita with
McGill, while Bates and I remained to look after
the property.</p>

<p>McGill insisted that with the load off he would
be able to haul the wagon back to Bonita for
repairs, so we set to work and, after a struggle
with the trunks, got the vehicle in shape to be
drawn.</p>

<p>It was with great misgivings that I saw my
companions depart. It was not to my liking to
remain as a guardian of that mass of luggage.
Bates did not seem to mind it. He simply
offered me his last cigar, then lighted it himself
and sat down on the bare ground.</p>

<p>I think we could see in every direction for
twenty miles and more, except toward the
mountains, which were to the east, some five
miles distant.</p>

<p>“Well, Bates,” I said, “what are we going to
do? It’s getting mighty cold. The wind
sweeps down from that mountain as if we might
get a little of the storm brewing up there.”</p>

<p>“That’s no mistake, my boy, and if I am not
in error we are going to get snow inside of two
hours. Most extraordinary for Arizona.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we could arrange some
shelter with these trunks and roll of canvas?”</p>

<p>“Just the thing, my boy. Glad you suggested
it.”</p>

<p>So we set to work and built our house, forming
our walls by arranging the trunks in a square,
leaving a small opening to be used as a door.
On this we spread the great piece of canvas
which had been brought along to cover the
wagon in case of storm, thus making a roof.
That it might not be carried away by the wind,
which was now howling like a hurricane, we
weighted it with small boulders. With other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
rocks we built a small fireplace and chimney,
without and facing our door. With the limited
supply of wood, which was very scarce&mdash;sagebrush
and gnarled mesquite&mdash;we built a small
fire in our fireplace, much to our joy, for we
were now actually blue with the cold.</p>

<p>The sky was now thoroughly overcast with
snow-clouds and the snow was beginning to fall,
settling in miniature drifts beneath the sage
bushes.</p>

<p>In removing the trunks from the wagon our
labours had been heavy, and we realized, as
Bates expressed it, “we were twenty miles
from nowhere, and not a drop of water nearer
than Bonita.”</p>

<p>Bates rummaged through the kit for a drink
of any kind, but was only able to produce a
diminutive flask with about one swallow of
whisky in it. After offering this to me he took
it down with a cheering “Here’s to you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t throw away that flask, Bates,” I
called to him as I saw him taking aim at a near-by
sage bush. “I may be able to collect a
drink with that.”</p>

<p>I filled the little flask as full as I could
pack it with snow which I collected under the
bushes, then held it carefully over the fire,
reducing the snow to water. This barely gave
us enough to moisten our lips, and I gave it up.</p>

<p>Then we wrapped ourselves up in our blankets
and reclined inside our improvised house and
discussed matters.</p>

<p>“I say, Bates, what did you think of the
colonel’s story about Apaches being out?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Can’t say. I know if I were an Apache
and had a warm wigwam to crawl into, the
warpath could go to perdition. I’m sure I
wouldn’t bother with it this kind of weather.
You won’t have the pleasure of meeting Geronimo,
’Apache Kid,’ nor any other human&mdash;and,
I might add, inhuman&mdash;being till the
weather lets up.”</p>

<p>“What have you got for protection in case
we do run across them?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, the only protection I have is a pair of
boots made by the Sun Shoe Company, which I
represent. With these on, and a fair start, I
might outrun them. That’s all I’ve got for
protection. What have you got?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, rather apologetically, “I have
a revolver here, but it isn’t much good. It
might do to fire salutes with, but I’m afraid it
would not do much execution. The fact is,
I’ve not fired the thing for some years.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, my boy. If you should
ever shoot me with that thing, and I should
find it out, I should be quite put out about it,”
said Bates, with a laugh. “We might as well
quit worrying. If the wild and woolly Apaches
get us, it’s fate. They’ll get us, that’s all. I’m
going to sleep.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he rolled over
and left me to my dreary thoughts. I tried to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
sleep and did drop into a light slumber, from
which I was suddenly awakened by a startled
exclamation from Bates.</p>

<p>As I opened my eyes he was just going
through the doorway on all fours.</p>

<p>“Bring that revolver here,” he called to
me.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible I was out after him.
He was gazing towards the mountains in the
distance.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” I asked, in some
alarm at the sudden call to arms.</p>

<p>He explained that something had come to the
door of our house. He could hear it, but only
caught a slight glimpse of it as he raised his
head, for it dashed out of sight immediately.
It was evidently an animal of some sort, for we
found the marks of its feet and claws in the soft
earth. Whatever it was we never caught sight
of it.</p>

<p>We were now thoroughly awake. The weather
had cleared, the sun was shining warmly and
my spirits were beginning to rise.</p>

<p>Far off, down the incline of the plain, we
could see the spot known as Bonita. Between
us and the town all was open, save for some
sage bushes here and there dotting the
view.</p>

<p>Surely McGill should now be on his way
back, but not a sign of him could we see.</p>

<p>We recalled the fact that we were hungry.
Bates rummaged in the kit. The net results
were a small paper of biscuits and a tin of beef&mdash;nothing
else.</p>

<p>We ate all the biscuits and half of the beef,
collected more firewood, and, at about six
o’clock, discovered the team slowly wending
its way from Bonita. It was more than an hour
before it arrived at our camp.</p>

<p>Another serious matter now confronted us.
Either we must stay with our improvised camp
or, as McGill suggested, make for Brick Dust
Canyon, in the mountain, where lived a
frontiersman named James W. Smith, who had
a little farm situated on an oasis of productive
earth in the midst of this vast wilderness of
alkali and sand.</p>

<p>Eventually we decided upon the latter alternative,
and succeeded in loading up and making
a start.</p>

<p>For a long time we crept upward, no one
riding except McGill, in order to relieve the
tired animals.</p>

<p>Reaching the summit of the ascent at last,
McGill stopped, for we had now to descend
into a deep canyon.</p>

<p>Daylight had by this time given way to
deepest night, and ahead all looked black and
forbidding. Our driver could not even see the
road, which was, moreover, obscured by a
growth of trees in the canyon.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said McGill, “this rig has no
brake to hold it. There is a big down-grade
here and a sharp turn at the bottom. From
there to Jim’s house is about a mile. We must
manage to stop one of the hind wheels, for these
mules will never be able to hold the load in
check; besides, I can’t see the road, and must
let the animals take their course.”</p>

<p>We tied the right rear wheel with a stout bit
of rope and started again, but with this difference&mdash;Levy,
Bates, and I each lighted cigars, which
Levy had brought from Bonita, and, puffing
vigorously at these, walked ahead of the load,
endeavouring to pilot McGill by the glow of the
lighted “stogies.”</p>

<p>There were times when the mules and the
locked wheel were insufficient to check the
wagon to any great extent, on account of the
steepness of the grade, but at first all went well.
It was not long before we reached the sharp
turn at the bottom. We were greatly in advance
of McGill now, and, indeed, we could hear
nothing of him, so Levy went back to investigate
and to warn him of the danger ahead. He
found the wagon halted at a fairly level spot to
recuperate the exhausted animals. Levy told
the Scotsman that he was about to plunge down
the last and most precipitous piece of road, and
urged him to give it up.</p>

<p>McGill was headstrong, however, and insisted
upon going ahead, so we took up our stand with
our cigars, to mark the turn at the bottom, and
the big vehicle started.</p>

<p>We could hear it gaining speed every moment.
Mingled with the rumbling of the wagon and the
clatter of the animals’ hoofs we heard the shouts
of McGill, who had now lost all control over his
team.</p>

<p>On they came with a rush and a roar, and we,
who were lighting the way, discovered we were
in some danger. At the last moment we sprang
back into the rocks and brush at the side as the
team swept irresistibly on.</p>

<p>The leaders took the turn all right, but the
next instant there was a crash and a yell from
McGill. The wagon had left the road and
plunged into a tree, the harness gave way, and
Bedlam broke loose.</p>

<p>The Scotsman saved his skin by jumping fairly
into a bush, while we sprang to the animals’
heads to check them. They showed, however,
no disposition on their part to run away; they
knew when they had had enough.</p>

<p>Away down in the distance we could see a
light, which McGill said was at Jim’s house.
He would leave us with the animals and seek
assistance from the house, he told us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>“I shall go across-lots,” he shouted back to
us, “by a trail which will save a lot of walking.”</p>

<p>For hours Bates, Levy, and I awaited his
return in vain. We exhausted every topic of
conversation we could think of, and at last,
tired, disgusted, and feeling thoroughly out of
sorts, we set off down the road, taking the
animals with us.</p>

<p>Although we could still see the light, we
walked for a long time before we actually
arrived before a small adobe
house, which was surrounded
by a thick wall some eight feet
high. The road led us to a
pair of huge solid gates, which,
being closed, prevented us seeing
within. We called out,
and in a few seconds a voice
answered us, and we were conscious
of someone approaching
the gates with a lantern.</p>

<p>This proved to be Jim Smith
himself. He seemed to be in
a very merry mood, for,
although we were total
strangers, he almost laughed
in our faces. He had a story
to tell, it soon appeared, of a
misfortune which had befallen
our friend McGill.</p>

<p>It seemed that in attempting
to take his short cut
“across-lots,” the Scotsman
had struck a cattle trail, which
led to a watering-trough set
beside a newly-dug well, the
existence of which he knew
nothing of.</p>

<p>By a curious accident, he
walked straight into this well and
plunged into eight feet of water.</p>

<p>It happened that Smith was at that moment
bringing some young cattle into his walled
enclosure, and, hearing the muffled cries of
McGill in the well, believed they proceeded from
a cow in difficulties.</p>

<p>Lantern in hand, he made his way to the well
and called out. Judge of his surprise when he
heard a voice, as from the tomb, growl:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my bloomin’ pipe!”</p>

<p>Looking into the well, he discovered McGill
clinging to the sides as best he could with fingers
and nails. It was but a moment’s work to
throw him a line and bring him out, as sorry
and dejected-looking a scarecrow as one could
imagine. Strange to relate, it was all that Jim
could do to keep McGill from going back into
the well for his cherished briar, the loss of which
seemed to worry him greatly.</p>

<p>We found the Scotsman in a very bad temper,
complaining bitterly of the loss of his pipe,
which he told us he was smoking at the time
of his misfortune.</p>

<p>We received a hearty welcome from Jim
and his wife. The latter was busy soothing
their ten-months-old baby to sleep. There
they lived, in that little one-room house, eating,
sleeping, and cooking in the same apartment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">“SHOT-GUN JIM.”<br />
<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I began to speculate as to where we tired
travellers would find a place to
lay our heads. The house was
a solid adobe, without windows.
In the doorway hung a frame,
on which was fastened a strip
of canvas in lieu of a door.</p>

<p>A hearty meal was prepared
by Mrs. Smith, after which we
were invited to go out and
bring in our beds.</p>

<p>On our return we found
that Mrs. Smith and the babe
were already in the huge bed
in the corner. Jim was preparing
to follow, and we were
invited to spread our blankets
on the floor, which, like the
Bonita store, was mother earth.</p>

<p>Our sleep was far more restful
than on the previous night.
At an early hour we were
awakened by Smith, who
seemed to be worried about
something. I followed him to
the door of the house and discovered
that he was holding a
whispered conversation with a
stranger, a young fellow of
about eighteen years. As soon
as I approached they stopped
speaking and I was introduced
to the young man, whose name was given as
“Hank.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Smith spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We might as well tell ’em about it, Hank,”
he said. “They’ve got to know it sooner or
later. Tain’t safe to get out of this place now.
Besides, your horse is used up.”</p>

<p>I glanced in the direction indicated, and saw
a horse covered in lather, with drooping head and
general dejected appearance. I knew he must
have had fearful riding to be in this condition.</p>

<p>“Well, you tell ’em, Jim,” replied Hank.
“I reckon we’re here, all of us, to stay awhile.”</p>

<p>“I can’t afford to remain, Mr. Smith,” I said,
thinking that the wrecked wagon might be the
reason for the conversation. “If the outfit will
hold together I think we had better go on as
soon as possible.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<p>Smith looked at me with pitying eyes.</p>

<p>“You may never leave this place at all,” he
returned, gravely. “This young man is the
only survivor of a massacre, about ten miles
from here. ‘Apache Kid’ and his band are,
perhaps, at this very moment close to our gates.”</p>

<p>Instinctively I glanced at the gates, and
noticed for the first time that heavy timbers
were propped against them.</p>

<p>“Not only that, but McGill has disappeared,”
continued Smith. “I think he may have gone in
search of his pipe. We dare not risk going
outside the enclosure, and he must get back as
best he can.”</p>

<p>Just then the others of our party and
Mrs. Smith, with the babe in her arms, joined
us, having begun to realize that something was
amiss.</p>

<p>Then Jim began to organize his forces. First
he took an inventory of the available arms and
ammunition, calling on our party to exhibit such
weapons as we had about us.</p>

<p>Next Jim brought out a number of guns.
There were three excellent repeating rifles, with
several hundred rounds of ammunition, and an
old shot-gun, which proved of no value. Next
came Jim’s own pet&mdash;a beautiful double-barrelled
shot-gun. With these were several
boxes of ammunition. Last came a motley
array of “six-shooters,” a part of which were
serviceable and for which there was a limited
amount of ammunition. Two hand-axes and a
small affair for chopping firewood were counted
as weapons for close quarters.</p>

<p>The whole lot was delivered into the care of
Mrs. Smith, who was instructed to load the guns
and arrange the ammunition conveniently on a
table brought from the house.</p>

<p>At odd moments the good woman was
assembling quantities of food, so that, in case
of an attack, prolonged or otherwise, we might
have her services at the ammunition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hank had been sent to the top of
the house, which had a low, flat roof, where he
was keeping close watch with a pair of field-glasses.
He called to Jim that he believed he
had discovered McGill in the topmost branches
of a tree, a long distance up the canyon. It
appeared that he was making signals, for we
soon discovered that he occasionally waved a
white handkerchief, and he appeared to be trying
to draw our attention to something to the
south.</p>

<p>Presently Hank reported that McGill was
climbing down the tree, and in a moment he
was running down the road towards the house
as fast as his long legs would carry him. Jim
prepared to open one of the gates.</p>

<p>Just then a shot rang out, followed by others.
We could hear McGill coming full tilt. Jim
opened the gate a little way and reported that
a band of Indians were in close pursuit of the
Scotsman.</p>

<p>A moment later, breathless and exhausted,
McGill flung himself through the open gate,
which was speedily secured behind him.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible Jim ran a rough wagon
out of a shed and placed it alongside of the
wall. It was evident now why this latter had
been built high and strong; the reason for
placing the wagon beside it, however, was not
yet evident to us.</p>

<p>Soon we heard the rush of a score of Indian
horses, the whoops and yells of their savage
riders, and the crack of their rifles.</p>

<p>Their shots did no damage, however, but were
sufficiently accurate to cause Hank to dodge
behind the stone chimney, whence he dropped
over the edge to the ground.</p>

<p>There was a savage onslaught upon the
immense heavy gates, but they held firm, being
well braced by the timbers. So far not a
sound had escaped us, and it was evident that
the Indians were chagrined that they had not
made a greater impression.</p>

<p>For a few moments we could hear them in
consultation before the gates, and presently a
voice called out in broken English.</p>

<p>To this no reply was made, nor was any
evidence of life vouchsafed from our side.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” whispered Jim, “get ready.
They’re going to show their heads in a minute&mdash;just
over there, near the wagon. That is the
easiest place for them to look over, and I have
tried to make it look more inviting. So look
alive and each pick his game. Don’t miss, or
there’ll be trouble.”</p>

<p>Next moment five ugly Apache heads bobbed
up over the wall simultaneously. They were
evidently so sure that the place was unprotected
that four of them, in their enthusiasm, clambered
half-way on top of the wall before they became
aware of the reception that had been planned
for them.</p>

<p>The volley that followed their appearance was
almost like one shot, and the four most daring
red-skins received the bullets intended for them.
Two were killed instantly, and partly hung over
the wall as they doubled up; two others, mortally
wounded, slid off the wall and were dragged
away by their companions. The less venturesome
got away with a whole skin.</p>

<p>With our volley pandemonium seemed to
break loose; the red-skins let out a yell that
fairly chilled us to the bone. Jim called us to
seek shelter at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>We were none too soon, for a terrific fire was
poured into the enclosure by the Indians, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
were taking haphazard shots towards us, without
putting their heads into jeopardy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i078.jpg">
<img src="images/i078.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“THE VOLLEY FOLLOWING THEIR APPEARANCE WAS ALMOST LIKE ONE SHOT.”</p>
</div>

<p>Presently we discovered that one lot of the
savages were trying to burrow under the gates,
and were indeed making some headway. Jim
seemed to be everywhere at once, using his
shot-gun as his sole means of defence. The
moment a hand was seen in the growing excavation
under the gate he let drive with his
shot-gun, and another Indian was out of
commission.</p>

<p>I remember I kept a sort of mental tally of
the fallen. Hank had told me that there were
about twenty-three in the band, so I calculated:
“Four dead on the first attack on the wall;
one shot through the hand, under the gate.
Balance to their credit&mdash;eighteen.”</p>

<p>Just then we received an unexpected shock.
We saw a curl of smoke rising above the gates;
the savages were piling brush against them, to
which they had already set fire. This was a
serious matter, which even Jim had not calculated
upon. He ordered us to lie low while he
took a look round.</p>

<p>I was so interested to know what he would
do that I could not resist the temptation to put
my head around the corner of the house, and
this is what I saw.</p>

<p>Jim crept on hands and knees towards the
wagon which we had placed against the wall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
In a moment he had reached it, shot-gun in
hand, and silently and slowly raised himself into
it, gradually straightening out with his head and
arms just above the wall. Then, quick as a
flash, he took aim. There was a crash&mdash;or
rather a double crash, for he had fired both
barrels&mdash;an awful yell from the Indians, and he
was speeding back to safety.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i079.jpg">
<img src="images/i079.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“I FELT MYSELF BEING DRAGGED OVER.”</p>
</div>

<p>One savage, braver than the rest, took a quick
shot at him. The bullet did no harm to Jim,
but came near being fatal to me, for I had been
so intent on watching him that I now found
that I had unconsciously stepped into the open.</p>

<p>Instead of bolting for shelter, I had but one
thing in mind&mdash;to check up the account and
see how many “good” Indians there were and
how many bad ones.</p>

<p>Consequently, in a moment&mdash;foolhardy as it
may seem&mdash;I was on the wagon, peering over
the wall, taking account of the dead and
wounded at the gates.</p>

<p>Although Jim’s shot-gun had done fearful
execution, there were but two who appeared to
be actually dead.</p>

<p>Just then something struck me in the face, a
hand grasped me from over the wall, and I felt
myself being dragged over, into the arms of the
“Apache Kid” himself! Several other savages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
were running to his assistance. All that I can
recall is that I thought my last hour had come,
and struck out blindly with my fists, clinging, as
best I could, to the wall with my legs.</p>

<p>I am not an experienced boxer, but I had the
advantage over my assailant, for I was uppermost.</p>

<p>Things seemed to be going badly with me,
however, for I felt my hold on the wall gradually
weakening.</p>

<p>Just at that instant I heard a rush behind me.
I was so done up that I could only think of
more Indians, but in reality it was Levy, Hank,
and Jim coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>I was grasped from behind and felt that I
should be pulled to pieces. I let out with my
fists with renewed vigour, and landed such a
fierce tattoo on the face of my captor that he
involuntarily sought to protect his face with his
hands, whereupon Levy, Hank, Jim, and I fell
into a confused heap over the side of the
wagon.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes before they restored me
to my senses, and I found myself with clothing
half torn off, covered with dust, and generally
bruised.</p>

<p>My first words were:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Two killed, three wounded badly; net
balance thirteen. That number is unlucky.
We’ll win!”</p>

<p>“What in the name of common sense are you
talking about?” asked Bates, who was bending
over me.</p>

<p>“Well, there were twenty-three Indians when
we started; we killed four at first shot, three at
the second, and two at the third, besides
wounding three beyond present help. That
leaves thirteen, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>We were recalled to a sense of our peril by
the sound of breaking timbers. The gates were
being forced!</p>

<p>Through the chinks we could see the Indians
working industriously with a battering-ram,
improvised from the trunk of a tree. At any
moment the gates might fall, and we knew there
would be little hope for us once the red-skins
gained an entrance.</p>

<p>Jim now sent his wife inside the house for
better protection. The little babe had, up to this
time, been peacefully sleeping on the bed, which
must now be used to barricade the door of the
house. Consequently, the little fellow was
disturbed as his mother moved the huge affair
against the opening, and he, too, added to the
din of the engagement.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen,” said Jim, “we’ve got to
make a last stand. The gates will be down in
a minute; they have been greatly weakened by
the fire. Every one of you to the roof!”</p>

<p>Up to the roof we climbed as a last resort.
I think we all realized the gravity of the
situation.</p>

<p>We stretched ourselves flat, weapons in hand,
and waited. It seemed ages. We could hear
the cries of the infant mingled with the sobs of
the distracted mother. Bates, who had an
abominable voice, tried to sing a hymn. Smith
told him to be quiet&mdash;the situation was trying
enough without his music.</p>

<p>Presently there came a crash&mdash;the gates were
down. In rushed the red-skins, a fearless crowd.
There were just thirteen; I counted them.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, let ’em have it,” called
Jim, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Well, we did let them have it; there was no
mistake about that. There was a blaze from
the rifles, Jim’s shot-gun, and the revolvers, and
we all pumped lead as fast as we could.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared a little we looked
below. There were eight red-skins as dead as
ever they could be. Three more were crawling
away on all fours, seriously wounded.</p>

<p>This left two on my record unaccounted for.
We soon spied them making off over the little
hills towards Brick Dust Canyon as fast as their
legs could carry them.</p>

<p>One of them was “Apache Kid,” the leader.
He got off with a whole skin, but I’ll wager that
he had some marks about his face.</p>

<p>When we got down from the roof we could
no longer hear Mrs. Smith or the babe, and
feared they had been killed by stray bullets.
Repeated calls failed to bring response.</p>

<p>When we forced an entrance we found her in
a dead faint, lying on the bed beside the infant,
who was chewing his fist and chuckling as if in
great glee.</p>

<p>Woman-like, Mrs. Smith deferred her swoon
till all danger was past.</p>

<p>To the delight of McGill, his miserable briar
was recovered that day by Jim, who said he did
not want the well spoiled, otherwise he would
have left it there.</p>

<p>“Shot-gun Jim”&mdash;for that is how he is always
known now, on account of his fearful execution
with his shot-gun, for it was he who really saved
the day&mdash;has never been troubled by Apaches
since. He still insists on living in that forsaken
spot, forgetful of the terrible scenes of carnage
and danger he has passed through, working at a
copper mine which he discovered up beyond
Brick Dust Canyon.

<h2><span class="hidden">A Perilous Mission.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap medium">By S. F. Martin, late of the Royal Niger Company’s Service.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The modestly-told story of a daring deed. At a time of great anxiety, when England and France were
on the verge of conflict in Africa and the powerful Mohammedan native States were watching for an
opportunity of throwing off the yoke of both countries, Mr. Martin was District Agent of the Royal Niger
Company at Borgu. He was instructed to secure reliable information as to what was happening in the
turbulent robber kingdom of Kontogora, and he obtained it by the hazardous expedient of disguising himself
as a Haussa and, taking his life in his hands, penetrating right into the enemy’s capital. His adventures
during this journey are set forth below, though the narrative contains barely a hint of the strain of
the ordeal or the awful fate that would have befallen the author had his real identity been suspected.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Towards</span> the latter end of 1898,
before the conquest of Nigeria, I
was placed in charge of the interests
of the Royal Niger Company,
Chartered and Limited, in the
Borgu district of the Niger Territories. My
instructions, amongst other things, were to
watch events, political and otherwise, and to
report the same to head-quarters.</p>

<p>It was a time of great stress and no little
peril to our West African Empire, for not only
were the various races of the Territories in a
state of unrest and hostility to the white man’s
domination, but at that period we were also at
loggerheads with the French, whose troops were
encroaching on our frontiers from all sides,
necessitating a special field force being formed,
under Colonel (later General Sir Frederick)
Lugard, to deal with the situation. The native
Mohammedan States, seeing this, thought to take
advantage of the crisis to the detriment of both
nations.</p>

<p>The most turbulent of all these native States
was Kontogora, a town lying to the eastward of
the Niger River. At the time of which I write
there were British troops at Jebba, Leabba,
Boussa, Roffia, Gomba, Lafagon, and Illa, as
well as smaller garrisons scattered about, all on
the Niger. There was a strong force also at
Zaria, a large town away to the east, some distance
south of Kano. The French were prowling
about in between.</p>

<p>It being reported that Kontogora was preparing
to take up arms, I determined to find out
the facts of the case for myself, as, if this State
seriously intended causing trouble and gained
any successes against us, the whole Mohammedan
Empire was sure to rise to a man, and it would
be difficult for us to hold our own, to say
nothing of expelling the French. My orders
were to remain in Boussa, but, having weighed
the pros and cons very carefully, and decided
that it would be well within the spirit, if not
exactly the letter, of my instructions to take the
action I intended, I determined to find out in
person how far this rumour was true and how
great the danger really was to our Imperial
interests. I had mastered the Haussa tongue,
the prevailing language of those regions, and
could hold my own easily with the Haussas
themselves, my natural aptitude for picking up
tongues standing me in good stead. Consequently,
without informing anyone where I
was going, beyond leaving word that I was off
on a shooting trip, on the night of the 17th of
November, 1898, I dyed myself from head to
foot a deep brown, arrayed myself in very
shabby Haussa clothes, and set off, with my
guide, Mama, for Kontogora. I took the name
of “Abdu Maidowda”&mdash;Abdu the dirty. All
carriers in Haussaland take nicknames, given
them by their masters or companions. It is
seldom that a white man ever knows the real
names of his servants.</p>

<p>We tramped all that night, and next morning
stopped at a small village in the midst of farmlands
in the N’gaski Kingdom. The whole
country hereabouts was bitterly hostile to the
white man’s <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. The state of unrest
was manifest everywhere; people went armed
to their work in the fields, as raids from
neighbouring towns seemed to be of frequent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
occurrence. Although the various native kingdoms
were quite at one with regard to their
hatred of the white man, yet amongst themselves
they were always warring and raiding for slaves&mdash;the
big towns bullying the smaller villages.
The main cause of this was the heavy slave
tribute levied by the Sultan of Sokoto&mdash;the
great head of the Moslem Church in the Sudan&mdash;on
all his vassal States.</p>

<p>Having rested for a few hours, we set out
again about midday. It was fiercely hot as
we trudged through the guinea-corn fields that
stretched for miles all around us, and the heat,
striking down from the fiery sun, that hung
directly overhead, made me dizzy. I staggered
along at times in a
kind of hot, sweltering
day-dream&mdash;seeing
things that did
not exist, and thinking
the most absurd
thoughts. Once I
called a halt at a well
of very dirty water,
flung myself down on
my hands and knees,
and bathed my head
and neck for several
minutes, Mama looking
on amused. The
people in the fields
were gathering in the
corn in feverish haste,
but every now and
then they paused long
enough to question
us as to our destination
and whence we
came. We invariably
told the same tale&mdash;we
were travelling to
Kontogora from
Illorin.</p>

<p>It must have been
about 4 p.m., judging
by the sun, when, on
that second day out,
we topped a rise of rocky ground and came face
to face with the head of a caravan of some thirty
people, with a large number of goats, coming
from the westward. There were several women
on donkeys, ten armed men on horseback, and
the balance consisted of carriers. As we stood
watching them the caravan halted and one of
the horsemen came prancing up to us with a
great flourishing of his spear. He asked us, very
roughly, whence we came and whither we were
bound. Mama answered that we were from
Illorin, whither we had taken loads for a rich
merchant from Kano, and were now bound for
Kontogora, where we hoped to obtain work, as
we understood that the Emir was preparing for
war on the white man. He then asked our
questioner if we might not join his caravan, and
if he would let us carry a load each in return for
our food. At this we were taken before the
head of the party, who proved to be an enormously
fat woman. With a wave of the hand
she gave her consent, and we were forthwith
enlisted in the line of coolies.</p>

<p>We pushed on that afternoon to some farmhouses,
where we halted for the night. The fat
lady took up her abode in the headman’s hut,
and we carriers wandered about to find quarters
for ourselves. For
the most part we slept
in the open, beneath
a great tree growing
outside the entrance
to the headman’s
compound. Mama
and I had no intention
of losing sight
of our companions,
as we did not wish
to let slip this excellent
chance of getting
in to Kontogora,
which was also the
destination of the
caravan, without
danger of possible
discovery. The farm
people were good
enough to give us
food and drink, and
also supplied us with
plenty of firewood.</p>

<p>After sitting around
the fire for a short
time, we coolies one
by one curled up on
our mats (each
carried a small grass
mat) and, with our
feet to the fire, slept
the dreamless sleep of the utterly weary.</p>

<p>Next morning I was awakened by Mama
shaking me by the shoulder. My clothes were
wet with dew, and I commenced to shiver with
cold, cursing myself in my sleepy condition for
being so foolish as to put myself in such a
perilous predicament.</p>

<p>As I arose and stretched myself I beheld
silent forms passing to and fro, and signs that
the world was awakening became increasingly
evident. Then fires were lit and breakfast
cooked; but not before we had washed our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
eyes, mouth, and hands, uttering a few words
from the Koran the while. After partaking of
boiled guinea-corn and soup, we espied the
fat lady preparing to mount her donkey, and,
securing our loads, took our place in the column
that began to form up. Soon we were once
again trudging through the open country on our
way to Kontogora.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i083.jpg">

alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“ONE OF THE HORSEMEN CAME PRANCING UP TO US WITH A GREAT FLOURISHING OF HIS SPEAR.”</p>
</div>

<p>All along the route I was struck with the
apparent haste with which the people were
gathering in the corn. Our companions told us
that the Seriki (King) of Kontogora was preparing
to wage war on the white man, and had
ordered his people to get in all their corn at
once.</p>

<p>The day before we entered Kontogora we
were overtaken by a raiding party, who were
returning to that place with their spoil&mdash;about
twenty young girls and women, as well as several
little children&mdash;all tied together, each having one
wrist made fast to the neck, across the chest.</p>

<p>Their captors were Fulehs and Haussas, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
horseback, armed with swords and spears, and
one or two with guns. Some of the poor captives
looked terribly emaciated, and could hardly
get along. I saw one woman get a slash of a
hippo hide whip across the face, that sent her
reeling to the ground, with a great gash on her
forehead. The incident stopped the whole
column for a few minutes, as the woman was
fastened to her fellow-prisoners by the neck,
and, when she fell, prevented them from advancing.
The whip was then applied freely in all
directions. The chief of the band ordered the
wounded woman’s squirming comrades to pick
her up and carry her, but they were unable to
do so, being too utterly worn out, I could see.
They were coated in dust from head to foot,
and the perspiration trickling down their naked
skins and mingling with the dust made the
poor things appear a sorry sight. The band
had, apparently, captured them at some far-distant
spot, and must have brought them along
at a great pace, judging by the rate they were
going when they overtook us.</p>

<p>Furious at their inability to pick the woman
up, the ruffian in command raised his spear
and plunged it three times into the body of the
prostrate woman. He followed this up by
actually trampling her under his horse’s feet,
while I groaned in an agony of horror and
impotent rage at the ghastly spectacle.</p>

<p>The brute, having satisfied himself that his
victim was dead, cut the grass rope that bound
her to her fellows with a slash of his sword, and
ordered the party to proceed. They left us at
a quick walk&mdash;some of the poor captives even
running in their terror&mdash;and were soon out of
sight over a rise in the ground. Our party
followed at a slower pace in dead silence, leaving
the poor mangled thing by the roadside to
provide a meal for the vultures and hyenas that
would soon be on the scene. I for one, however,
realized then that no wild beast of the desert
could compare for utter brutality and lust for
blood with the human satyrs who overran that
land at the time of which I write. For miles
around, between Kontogora and the Niger, and
farther afield to the north, south, and east, the
smoking ruins of raided villages told the ever-repeated
tale of death and violence, robbery
and rapine, and I knew full well what would
happen to me should my disguise, by any
mischance, be penetrated.</p>

<p>About five miles outside Kontogora our
caravan was stopped by some horsemen who
came galloping towards us and drew up across
our path. They had a long parley with our
chiefs before allowing us to proceed, and only
did so on payment of a toll. These men were
scouts, and I found out later that the whole
country for five miles around the city was
effectually patrolled, no one being allowed to
enter or leave without permission. When we
finally arrived outside the walls of Kontogora it
was night, and in the moonlight the scene was
beautiful and striking. The high castellated
ramparts, with watch-towers over the gates, looked
strange and fantastic in the soft, mysterious light.</p>

<p>As we approached the gate we mingled with
the members of another caravan. Mama and I
were at the tail of the line, about five or six
from the end. We chose this position to minimize
the possibility of trouble, although there
really seemed little chance of that in such a
deceptive light. Still, there was just the chance,
as we soon found out when the head of the
caravan reached the gate. Here it was abruptly
ordered to halt, and the guards held quite a
long palaver before it was allowed to proceed.
At the same time a little incident occurred that
made my blood run cold for a few minutes.
There was a cry of “Abokai! Abokai! Kai!”
(“Friends! Friends! Halloa, there!”) from
the gate, and the whole column was soon calling
“Aboki! Aboki!” (“Friend! Friend!”)&mdash;the
Haussa manner of hailing anybody.
They were shouting, it soon appeared, for
myself and Mama, and we were speedily
hustled forward by our companions. When
we reached the gate our employer, the fat
lady merchant who had engaged us, indicated
us to the guards with a haughty wave of the
hand. We could see a crowd of mounted and
unmounted men in the darkness of the gateway,
and one among these, who seemed gigantic in
the moonlight as he rode forward on a horse
equally gigantic, curveted up to us. Striking
my turban from off my head with the tip of
his spear, he loudly asked for our names. I
answered that we were two poor travellers from
Illorin, come to offer our services to the Emir.
He asked us where our belongings were and the
money that our master had paid us at Illorin.
I told him that the white man had met us on
the road and taken everything, as we were
friends of Kontogora. At this the captain of
the gate gave vent to some extremely sulphurous
language. Then, with a slight movement of the
reins, he caused his horse to rear up on his
hind legs and, with pawing fore-feet, to burst
furiously through the crowd of coolies round
about us, trampling one or two badly. Finally,
the caravan was allowed to move on under the
gate into the town. As we entered, the <i>mallams</i>
(priests) were calling to prayer, and the long-drawn
cry, like an appeal for mercy, floated
through the night, striking on the air with that
strange, indefinable sense of mysticism that
belongs to the East alone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>We wound in and out, out and in, through
the moonlit streets with their black shadows,
their mud walls, and conical, thatch-roofed
houses. Then we emerged into the market-place,
near which our employer resided. Entering
her compound, we put down our loads,
and, seating ourselves, awaited our wages.
Mama and I were the first to be paid. We were
handed one string apiece of cowrie shells&mdash;equivalent
to one shilling each, at that time
and place. We haggled over this like true-born
carriers for fully half an hour, and, as the fat
lady’s head slave refused to budge, accepted
what we got with a blessing&mdash;and promptly
received another five hundred cowries for our
good nature. The Haussa will often do this,
for, as much as he fears a curse, by so much
does he value a blessing. A great many rogues
take advantage of this trait in the native character.</p>

<p>Having been paid off, Mama and I left the
compound rejoicing. Here we were, in the very
heart of Kontogora&mdash;scatheless! We wandered
into the market-place, where some people were
still loitering, and decided to sleep in one of the
stalls and begin our investigations in the morning.</p>

<p>It was many hours before I got to sleep, as
my feet ached fearfully and were badly torn and
blistered. During the march I had alternately
gone barefoot and in sandals to rest them, and
at times I got badly knocked about when carrying
the leathers in my hand. Several times
during the night bands of young Haussas passed
through the market-place, shouting and laughing,
boasting what they were going to do to the
Turawa (white man).</p>

<p>Four batches of labourers passed through
also, between the time we retired and dawn,
dragging dead horses out of the town. Tom-toms
were going all the night; at times the
whole air quivered with the rhythmical sounds.
The quaint tinkling of the Haussa guitar rose
and fell at intervals, and from time to time the
weird notes of the “ghoghie,” or native fiddle,
could be heard from the compounds. A spirit
of excitement and revel seemed to pervade the
whole town.</p>

<p>Next morning we loitered about until the
market began to fill, when we bought some
food. We then repaired to the Galadima’s
residence, and enlisted in the army of labourers
that were employed in repairing the walls of the
town. Many of these labourers were slaves,
sent by the various chiefs and big men; others
belonged to the Emir himself. About four
hundred of us were dispatched to the north
wall. Here some made bricks out of the soft
clay; others, including myself, stood on the
wall and laid them, and yet others passed those
already dried up to us on the wall.</p>

<p>While working in this way I gathered a lot of
information. Raiding parties had been out all
the week, I learned, and spies and runners
from Zaria brought in news every day concerning
the movements of the white men in
that city. Bands of armed men were continually
bringing in slaves from the ruined
villages in the surrounding country. It was
said that N’gaski and Kontogora would join
forces, attack the whites in Zaria, and drive
them out. Dandugnsu and Ridjion, neighbouring
towns, had promised their support in
the campaign. I also learnt that orders had
come in from the Sultan of Sokoto that the
Emir was not to commence a war against the
white man, but to remain on the defensive.
The Emir of Kontogora had replied that he was
quite prepared to meet all comers, from whatever
direction&mdash;a pretty broad hint to Sokoto, I
thought. One fellow laying bricks told Mama
that the man who killed Lieutenant Thomson
at Bida, in the late Niger Sudan campaign
undertaken by the Chartered Company against
the Fulehs of Bida and Illorin, was now in the
town and was considered a very great hero.</p>

<p>About midday an order came for some twenty
men to repair to the Emir’s compound. I was
chosen as one of the gang, together with Mama.
So off we marched. When we arrived we found
that a horse and a cow had died, and were to
be dragged out of the town and thrown into the
moat under the walls. Tying up the hind legs
with grass rope, we hauled the carcasses through
the streets and out by one of the gates and
dumped them into the ditch. Having finished
our unpleasant task, we trudged back to the
north wall and recommenced laying bricks.</p>

<p>One swaggering youngster had annoyed me
very much all the morning. He was an overseer
amongst the men, and apparently one
of the wealthy young bloods of the town.
Shortly after my return from removing the dead
horse this youth strutted up to me and started
cursing me roundly in Haussa, saying that I
was more like a woman than a man and that
my work was no good. Finally, raising his
hand, he struck me in the mouth. Forgetting
myself completely for the moment, I stepped up
to the fellow, who promptly drew his sword.
Without any trouble I disarmed him; then,
catching him by the neck, I shook him like a
rat and dropped him into the ditch on the far
side of the wall.</p>

<p>For a moment there was dead silence; next a
chorus of applause and laughter broke out.
But Mama plucked me by the sleeve. “Go,”
he said, in a low tone; “I will meet you to-night,
an hour after sundown, at the place we
slept in last night.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<p class="caption">“I SHOOK HIM LIKE A RAT AND DROPPED HIM INTO THE DITCH.”</p>
</div>

<p>Divining my danger, I slipped away and
mingled with the crowd, nobody venturing to
interfere. I passed down some side streets that
zigzagged about confusingly, wandered in the
outskirts of the town for an hour or more, and
then made my way to the market-place, which
I found swarming with people.</p>

<p>Buying some boiled guinea-corn, I sat down
outside a stall and munched my lunch. The
woman who sold me the food was a garrulous old
person, but perfectly good-natured. She asked
me all about myself, and I told her that
I had come from Zaria, where I had fled
through fear of the white men. She informed
me that I had nothing to fear from them;
were it not for their guns they would be quite
harmless. Then I asked her when it was that
Kontogora intended setting out to drive the
Turawa from Zaria. “Go round the blacksmiths’
shops and inquire at the smithies,” was all the
answer I could get. I thought the idea a good
one, and, bidding my new friend “Good day,”
I sauntered through the crowded market-place,
stopping at various booths. In one of these
some blacksmiths were hard at work, making
arrow and spear heads from bits of iron and tin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
As I stood looking at them I gathered, from the
conversation that was going on around, that some
of the Emir’s sons were expected to arrive in
Kontogora that day, and that they were bringing
some of the white men’s guns with them that were
taken at Hella, when Lieutenant Keating’s party
was massacred. Here was a bit of news worth
having! The conversation turning on matters
that did not interest me, I strolled on until I
arrived at the head blacksmith’s shop, near the
Emir’s compound, where I watched the hammers
pounding the red-hot metal. I could see that
the whole town was busy making arms, which
boded ill for the whites.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a shout of “Gashi! Gashi!”
(“There he is! There he is!”). Then there was
a rush of feet, and a flash of swords in upraised
arms. Evidently my pursuers had found me
out. I backed into the blacksmith’s shop,
followed by a yelling crowd, and caught a
momentary glimpse of my tormentor of the
morning. Then, without warning, something
was thrown over my head, and I was dragged
violently backwards, flung to the ground, and
stunned by a succession of heavy blows.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses I found myself
being hauled unceremoniously to my feet, my
arms bound firmly. In this ignominious state I
was dragged amid curses and cuffs through the
town, a yelling crowd of bloodthirsty ruffians
surrounding me. They hauled me through a
doorway into a compound surrounded with high
walls, on into a big building, through many
rooms and passages, and ultimately down some
rough steps into a filthy, stinking dungeon,
reeking of mould and damp. Here, with a
violent push, I was flung headlong to the
bottom, where I lay helpless in absolute
darkness.</p>

<p>The air was damp and chill, and the place
was infested with all manner of loathsome
crawling things; I could hear them tick-ticking
and scuffling along the floor and walls. Shortly
after my entry some filthy thing touched my
fingers, and I shook it off with a yell. It was
a dread place, and drove all hope of saving my
life clean out of me.</p>

<p>How long I lay there I do not know; it was
long enough, at any rate, for a sharp attack
of fever to seize me and run its course. It
racked my bones; I tossed and turned on the
slimy floor, groaning aloud in my discomfort.
The hot fever-blood throbbed in my head;
my eyes and face burned, and my body became
parched and dry. I moaned for water&mdash;oh,
for one drop of cool water! At one time I
thought I saw the door open and Mama enter
and loose my bonds, but it was only a vision
of my disordered brain. Finally I sank into
unconsciousness. I awoke&mdash;drenched in a profuse
perspiration&mdash;with men’s voices sounding
round about me. A figure was standing over me
holding a lamp&mdash;an earthenware, ewer-shaped
vessel with a cotton dip&mdash;which gave a wavering
yellow radiance and cast grim dancing shadows
on the walls. I could see that the door was ajar,
and a pale light was stealing into the horrible
place from outside. Roughly I was dragged
to my feet. I staggered a bit, but soon steadied
myself, and&mdash;pushed, cursed, and beaten&mdash;I
accompanied my captors up the steps and out
into the light of day again, or, rather, of evening.
One glorious breath of the upper air repaid me
for all that I had suffered in that black hole of
Kontogora. I did not care now if they were
leading me out to kill me; I was not going to
die like a rat in that horrible pit.</p>

<p>As we emerged from the compound we were
joined by a chattering, mocking, hostile crowd
of men, women, and children. Every now and
then one of the latter would strike me with a
stick, my guards making no effort to protect me.
At last we entered the Emir’s compound and I
was taken into his presence. He was seated on
a dais covered with mats and a leopard skin,
and was talking in a low monotone to some men
lying round about him on the floor of the
chamber.</p>

<p>The young blood that I had flung over the
wall, and who was the cause of all my troubles,
stepped out and told the King what I had done,
asking leave to kill me then and there. Next,
to my astonishment, Mama stepped out of the
crowd and told the Emir plainly that he and I
had come all the way from Illorin to serve him,
and had intended craving his permission that
morning had not my tormentor interfered and
sought a quarrel with me, in which he had got
thrown over the wall for his pains. Subsequently,
through treachery, continued my faithful
guide, my enemy had had me taken and
flung into prison without the Emir’s knowledge.</p>

<p>The Emir, who seemed a decent sort of old
man, listened patiently to his two petitioners.
Then, advising my enemy to calm himself, he
told one of his retainers to question me. I
thanked Heaven that the simpleness of my disguise
and my grip of the Haussa tongue precluded
any very great possibility of detection.
The Emir, before my questioner started, informed
the assembled crowd that, were I proved
to be a rebel and a traitor, he would hand me
over to my enemy to do what he wished with.</p>

<p>My inquisitor was a type of the grovelling
bully. He tried to put one or two posers to
me, but got more than he expected in return;
and I actually got a smile out of the Emir,
which elicited the loud and flattering applause
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
of the retainers, when I suggested that my questioner
was behaving very like a traitor himself
in trying to cast a slur on the character of one
of the Emir’s most faithful subjects. I told that
monarch that I had come all the way from
Illorin to serve him, and this was the way I was
being treated&mdash;dragged, beaten and bleeding,
before him from a dungeon, and bound like a
common slave. Suddenly the Emir asked me
how many white men there were in Borgu; I
told him about one hundred thousand, and more
to come. He seemed greatly impressed, as well
he might be. I then craved permission to enter
his service, and he inquired if I could ride. I
told him to try me. This he agreed to do. If
I could ride and prove myself worthy of entering
his service he said he would pardon my
imprudence of yesterday and make me a
member of his bodyguard.</p>

<p>My bonds were cut, and as these fell from me
the pain of the blood returning to my swollen,
half-numbed hands was excruciating. I managed,
however, to keep a brave face. We retired from
the Emir’s presence and waited outside under a
great shady tree, where, eventually, a fiercely-pawing
stallion was brought up, and I was
ordered to mount. This I did, the brute biting,
kicking, and plunging all the time. I had to
get into one of those horrible native saddles that
box you up completely, fore and aft. Once
mounted, I let the horse do as he pleased, and
he led me a terrible dance, rearing and plunging
about, dashing first to one side and then
another. As he was in the midst of his attempts
to buck me off, the Emir appeared and stood
watching the tussle with interest. As a matter
of fact, the horse had not much chance when
once I was on his back, for I had had a great
deal of experience of the Haussa beast, and
knew his ways. He soon grew tired, and within
half an hour was quite submissive. I used no
stick, but just sat quietly in the saddle. To my
surprise and delight the Emir told me that the
horse was mine, and that I was to come to see
him on the morrow, about noon. I thanked
him gratefully and rode off, Mama walking by
my stirrup.</p>

<p>After a consultation we agreed that it would
be dangerous to remain in the town any longer,
as our enemies were bound to try to get the
better of us, sooner or later. We therefore
arranged that Mama should leave the town at
once, and make for Boussa as best he could, on
foot; I would leave that night. We then parted,
and I was left alone in the midst of the enemy.</p>

<p>At sundown I rode through the south gate,
but was immediately stopped by the guard. I
told them that I came by order of the Emir, but
they demanded proof. This was distinctly
awkward, for, of course, I had no proof to
give. I therefore resolved upon a bold stroke.
I requested the chief to ride with me, telling
him I would give him in confidence all the
proof he would require. Unsuspectingly he
rode up alongside. Leaning over towards him,
I suddenly gripped him by the throat with both
hands, at the same time ramming my heels into
my horse’s sides. The startled animal leapt
forward, wrenching my opponent from the
saddle with a jerk, and I swung him across my
horse’s withers, where I held him&mdash;my right
hand on his throat, my left gripping his left
knee, bending him backwards like a bow. In
this fashion we flew along the path by which
two days before I had entered the robber city
on foot.</p>

<p>A howl of execration and a clatter of hoofs
followed us, and a shower of arrows and spears
fell harmlessly on either side of me. When we
had gone about a quarter of a mile I slid my
hapless prisoner off on to his head, intending to
stun him. My horse, feeling the relief, went
away at renewed speed, and I had no difficulty
in outdistancing my pursuers, especially as they
stopped to see to their unconscious chief. I
met one party of traders coming into the town,
but they stood aside to let me thunder past, not
doubting that I was an emissary of the Emir
on some urgent business. The moon was just
rising as I topped a low ridge, and all the world
was soon bathed in a soft and silvery veil of
light. Kontogora was far behind in the plain,
the thousand conical roofs away in the distance
looking strangely unreal.</p>

<p>As I drew near the five mile radius I began
to wonder how I was going to get through the
line of scouts. Capture now would mean death
in some horrible form or other; at all costs I
must not be taken alive. Suddenly I heard a
shout far away on my right, and in the dim light
saw a body of horsemen coming my way.
Touching my mount with my heels I again gave
him his head, and he flew like the wind, with
ever-increasing speed. The pace was terrific
and absolutely foolhardy in that light, although
the road was fairly good. I expected every
moment to be pitched head foremost to the
ground, but the surefooted beast kept on without
a stumble. The shouts and thunder of
hoofs behind grew fainter and fainter, until at
last, to my infinite relief, they entirely died
away. Still, however, I kept on. Here and
there, when the road passed through a village
or beside a farm, frightened figures would slink
away into the shadows and a startled cur would
burst into a violent fit of barking, as I clattered
by on my panting steed, now reeking and white
with sweat.

<p class="caption">“IN THIS FASHION WE FLEW ALONG THE PATH.”</p>
</div>

<p>I rode fast all through the night, my horse
showing splendid spirit and pluck, and at sunrise
halted on the banks of a river. Leaving
my hard-ridden beast to cool a little first, I then
watered him and, cutting some guinea-corn
stalks from a patch near by, gave him a good
feed, munching some myself at the same time
and quenching my thirst at the river. Then,
after about two hours’ rest, I proceeded, but at
a lesser speed.</p>

<p>I rode all that day and well into the night,
finally resting by the pool where I had cooled
my heated brow on the way to Kontogora.
After some hours’ halt I pushed on again,
obtaining food at farmhouses on the way, and
next evening, utterly weary, arrived at the Niger
opposite Boussa. My journey was over; I was
safe at last! Arriving at my quarters in the
Niger Company’s compound, I flung myself
down on my camp bed just as I was and slept
for sixteen hours.</p>

<p>The faithful Mama turned up four days later.
He went to Yauri, a friendly State, coming down
river by canoe. For his services I presented
him with the Emir of Kontogora’s horse.</p>

<p>During all the years that have gone by since
my secret trip to Kontogora and my subsequent
escape I have never regretted having run the
double risk of disobeying orders on the one
hand and risking my life on the other. I
had been instructed to get news and I got
it&mdash;not the idle tales of paid spies, but a record
of sights seen and things heard with my own
eyes and ears.</p>

<span class="smcap medium">By Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell</span>, C.M.G.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Dr. Grenfell may be described as the “Good Angel of Labrador,” having for years devoted himself to
ministering to the hardy toilers who live in that grim land of snow, ice, and fog. In this enthralling
story he describes how, while on an errand of mercy, he and his dog-team got adrift in the open
sea on a tiny cake of ice; how he killed three of the dogs to provide himself with warm clothing; how
he made a flagstaff out of their bones; and how he was finally rescued when hope was well-nigh dead.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was Easter Sunday, but still
winter with us, and everything was
covered with snow and ice. Immediately
after morning service word
came from our hospital to say that
messengers with a large team of dogs had
come from sixty miles to the southward to
get a doctor for a very urgent case&mdash;that of a
young man on whom we had operated about
a fortnight before for an acute bone disease
in the thigh.</p>

</div>

<p>There was obviously no
time to be lost, so, having
packed up the necessary instruments,
dressings, and
drugs, and fitted out the sleigh
with my best dogs, I left at
once, the messengers following
me with their own team.</p>

<p>Late in April there is
always a risk of getting wet
through on the ice, so that I
was prepared with a spare
outfit, which included, besides
a change of garments, snow-shoes,
rifle, compass, an axe,
and oilskin over clothes.</p>

<p>My dogs, being a powerful
team, would not be held back,
and though I managed to
wait twice for the other
sleigh I had reached a
village about twenty miles
on the journey before nightfall,
had fed the dogs, and
was gathering one or two
people for prayers, when they caught me up.</p>

<p>During the night the wind shifted to the
north-east. This brought in fog and rain,
softened the snow, and made travelling very
bad, besides sending a heavy sea into the bay.
Our drive next morning would be somewhat
over forty miles&mdash;the first ten miles across a
wide arm of the sea, on salt-water ice.</p>

<p>In order not to be separated too long from
my friends, I sent them ahead two hours before
me, appointing a rendezvous at a log shanty we
had built in the woods for a half-way house.
There is no one living along all that lengthy
coast-line, and so, in case of accident, we keep
dry clothes, food, and drugs at the hut.</p>

<p>The first rain of the year was falling when I
left, and I was obliged to keep on what we call
the “ballicaters,” or ice barricades, much farther
up the bay than I had expected. The sea of
the night before had smashed up the ponderous
covering of ice right to the land-wash, and great
gaping chasms between the
enormous blocks, which we
call “pans,” made it impossible
to get off. As soon as
I topped the first hill outside
the village I could see
that half a mile out it was all
clear water.</p>

<p>An island which lies off
about three miles in the bay
had preserved a bridge of
ice, however, and by crossing
a few cracks I managed to
reach this island. The arm
of the bay beyond this point
is only about four miles
straight across. This would
bring me to a rocky promontory
and would save
some miles on the round. As
far as the eye could see the
ice seemed good, though it
was very rough. Obviously
it had been smashed up by
the sea, and packed in again
by the strong wind from the
north-east, but I judged it had frozen solid
together again.</p>

<p>I set off to cross this stretch, and all went
well till I was about a quarter of a mile from the
landing-point. Then the wind suddenly fell,
and I noticed I was travelling over loose “sish”
ice, almost of the consistency of porridge; by
stabbing down, I could drive my whip-handle
clean through it. This “sish” ice consists
of the tiny fragments made by large pans
pounding together on the heaving sea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>So strongly did the breeze now come off-shore,
and so quickly did the packed mass, relieved of
the wind pressure, begin to scatter, that already
I could not see one floe larger than ten feet
square. I realized at once that retreat was
absolutely impossible; the only thing to be done
was to make a dash for it and try to reach the
shore.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose, so I tore
off my oilskins, threw myself out on my hands
and knees by the side of the <i>komatik</i> to give a
larger base to hold, and shouted to the dogs to
go ahead.</p>

<p>Before we had gone twenty yards, the animals,
divining their peril, hesitated for a moment, and
the <i>komatik</i> instantly sank into the slush. It
then became necessary for the dogs to pull, and
they promptly began to sink in also. Earlier
in the season the father of the very man I was
going to operate on had been drowned by his
dogs tangling their traces around him in the
“slob.” This unpleasant fact now flashed into
my mind, and I managed to loosen my sheath-knife,
scramble forward, find the traces in the
water, and cut them, meanwhile taking a turn
with the leader’s trace around my wrist.</p>

<p>There was a pan of ice some twenty-five
yards away, about the size of a dining-table, and
on to this the leader very shortly climbed.
The other dogs, however, were hopelessly
bogged in the slushy ice and water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i091.jpg">
<img src="images/i091.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">“ONE OF THE DOGS GOT ON TO MY SHOULDERS, PUSHING ME
FARTHER DOWN IN THE ICE.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gradually I hauled myself along the leader’s
line towards the pan, till he suddenly turned
round and slipped out of his harness. It was
impossible to make any progress through the
“sish” ice by swimming, so I lay there helplessly,
thinking it would soon be over, and
wondering if anyone would ever know how the
tragedy happened. Suddenly I saw the trace of
another big dog, who had himself fallen through
just before he reached the pan. Along this I
hauled myself, using the animal as a bow anchor,
but much bothered by the other dogs, one of
which, in his struggle for life, got on to my
shoulders, pushing me farther down in the ice.
Presently, however, I passed my living anchor,
and soon, with my dogs around me, I lay on the
little piece of ice. I had to help the dogs on to
it, though they were able to work their way to
me through the lane of water that I had
made.</p>

<p>We were safe for the moment, yet it
was obvious that we must be drowned
before long if we remained on this
little fragment, so, taking off my
moccasins, coat, gloves, and cap, and
everything that I could spare, I tied my knife
and moccasins separately on to the backs of
the dogs. My only hope of life seemed to be to
get ashore at once. Had I been able to divine
the long drift before me, I might have saved, in
the same way as I saved my knife, a small bag
of food. The moccasins, made of tanned sealskin,
came right up to my thigh, and, as they
were filled with water, I thought they accounted
for my being able to make no progress.</p>

<p>Taking the long traces from all the dogs but
the two lightest, I gave them the full length of
the lines, tied the near ends around my own
wrists, and tried to make the animals go ahead.
Nothing would induce them to move, however,
and though I threw them off the pan two or
three times, they always struggled back on to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
Fortunately, I had with me a small black
spaniel, a featherweight, with large furry paws,
something like snow-shoes, who will retrieve for
me. I threw a piece of ice for him, and he
managed to get over the “slob” after it, on to
another pan about twenty yards away. The
other dogs followed him and after much painful
struggling all of them got on but one.</p>

<p>Taking all the run I could get on my little
pan, I made a rush, slithering with the impetus
along the surface till once more I sank through.
After a tough fight I was able to haul myself
by the long traces on to this new pan. I had
taken care this time to tie the harnesses, to
which I was holding, under the dogs’ bellies, so
that they could not slip them off. But the pan
I was now on was still not enough to bear us,
and so this exhausting process had to be
repeated immediately to avoid sinking with it.</p>

<p>I now realized, much to my dismay, that
though we had been working towards the land
we had been losing ground all the time, for the
off-shore wind had now driven us a hundred
yards farther out. The widening gap was full
of pounded ice, which rose to the surface as the
pressure lessened. Through this no man could
possibly make his way.</p>

<p>I was now resting on a floe about ten feet by
twenty, which, when I came to examine it, was
not ice at all, but simply snow-covered “slob,”
frozen into a mass, and which I feared would
very soon break up in the general turmoil and
the heavy sea, which was continually increasing
as the ice drove offshore before the wind.</p>

<p>At first we drifted in the direction of a rocky
point on which a heavy surf was breaking, and I
made up my mind, if there was clear water in
the surf, to try to swim for the land. But
suddenly we struck a rock, a large piece broke
off the already small pan, and what was left
swung around in the backwash and went right
off to sea. I saw then that my pan was
about a foot thick.</p>

<p>There was nothing now for it but to hope for
rescue. Alas! there was no possibility of
being seen by human eyes. As I have already
mentioned, no one lives round this big bay. It
was just possible, however, that the people on
the other <i>komatik</i>, knowing I was alone and had
failed to keep my tryst, would, perhaps, come
back to look for me. This, however, they
did not do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the westerly wind&mdash;our coldest
wind at this time of the year&mdash;was rising rapidly.
It was very tantalizing, as I stood there with
next to nothing on, the wind going through me,
and every stitch soaked in ice-water, to see my
<i>komatik</i> some fifty yards away. It was still
above water, packed with food, hot tea in a
Thermos bottle, dry clothing, matches, wood,
and everything for making a fire to attract
attention, if I should drive out far enough for
someone to see me&mdash;and yet it was quite beyond
my reach.</p>

<p>It is easy to see a black object on the ice in
the day-time, for its gorgeous whiteness shows
off the least thing. But, alas! the tops of
bushes and large pieces of kelp have so often
deceived those looking out that the watcher
hesitates a long time before he takes action.
Moreover, within our memory no man has ever
been thus adrift on the bay ice. The chances
were one in a thousand that I would be seen at
all, and, even if I were, I should probably be
mistaken for a fragment of driftwood or kelp.</p>

<p>To keep from freezing I took my long
moccasins, strung out some line, split the legs,
and made a kind of jacket, which preserved my
back from the wind down as far as the waist.</p>

<p>I had not drifted more than half a mile before
I saw my poor <i>komatik</i> disappear through the
ice, which was every minute loosening up into
small pans. The loss of the sledge seemed
like that of a friend, and one more tie with home
and safety lost.</p>

<p>By midday I had passed the island and was
moving out into the ever-widening bay. It was
scarcely safe to stir on the pan for fear of
breaking it, and yet I saw I must have the skins
of some of my dogs&mdash;of which there were eight
on the pan&mdash;if I was to live the night out.
There was now from three to five miles of ice
between me and the north side of the bay, so I
could plainly see there was no hope of being
picked up that day, even if seen, for no boat
could get out.</p>

<p>Unwinding the sealskin traces from my waist,
around which I had them coiled to keep the
dogs from eating them, I made a slip-knot and
passed it over the first dog’s head, tied it round
my foot close to its neck, threw him on his back,
and stabbed him to the heart. Poor beast! I
loved him like a friend, but we could not all
hope to live. In fact, at that time I had no
hope that any of us would, but it seemed better
to die fighting.</p>

<p>In the same way I sacrificed two more large
dogs, receiving a couple of bites in the process,
though I fully expected that the pan would
break up in the struggle. A short shrift seemed
to me better than a long one, and I envied the
dead dogs, whose troubles were over so quickly.
Indeed, I began to debate in my mind whether,
if once I passed into the open sea, it would not
be better by far to use my faithful knife on myself
than to die by inches. There seemed
no horror whatever in the thought; I seemed
fully to sympathize with the Japanese view of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
<i>hara-kiri</i>. Working, however, saved me from
dangerous philosophizing. By the time I had
skinned the dogs and strung the skins together
with some rope unravelled from the harnesses I
was ten miles on my way and it was already
getting dark.</p>

<p>Away to the northward I could now see a
single light in the little village where I had slept
the night before. One could not help picturing
them sitting down to tea, little thinking that
there was anyone watching them, for I had told
them not to expect me back for four days. I
could also see the peaceful little school-house on
the hill, where many times I had gathered the
people for prayer.</p>

</div>

<p>I had now frayed out some rope into oakum
and mixed it with some fat from the intestines
of my dogs, with the idea of making a flare.
But I discovered that my match-box, which was
always chained to me, had leaked, and my
precious matches were in pulp. Had I been
able to make a light, it would have looked so
unearthly out there on the ice that I felt sure
they would have seen me. However, I kept the
matches, hoping that I might be able to dry
them if I lived through the night. While working
at the dead dogs, about every five minutes I
would stand up and wave my hands towards the
land. I had no flag and I could not spare my
shirt, for, wet as it was, it was better than
nothing in that freezing wind, and, anyhow, it
was nearly dark.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the coves in among the cliffs
are so placed that only for a very narrow
space can the people in any house see the sea.
Indeed, most of them cannot see the sea at all,
so that whether it was possible for anyone to see
me I could not tell, even supposing it had been
daylight.</p>

<p>Not daring to take any snow from the surface
of my pan to break the wind with, I piled up the
carcasses of the dogs. Moreover, I could now
sit down on the skin rug without finding myself
in a pool of water, thawed out by my own heat.
During these hours I had continually taken off
all my things, wrung them out, swung them in
the wind, and put on first one and then the other
inside, hoping that what heat there was in my
body would thus serve to dry them. In this I
had been fairly successful.</p>

<p>My feet were the most trouble, for they immediately
got wet again on account of my thin
moccasins being easily soaked through on the
snow. I suddenly thought of the way in which
the Lapps, who tend our reindeer, manage to
dry socks. They carry grass with them, which
they ravel up and put into the shoe. Into this
they put their feet, and then pack the rest with
more grass, tying up the top with a binder. The
ropes of the harness for our dogs are carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
“served” all over with two layers of flannel, in
order to make them soft against the animal’s
sides. So, as soon as I could sit down, I started
with my trusty knife to rip up the flannel.
Though my fingers were more or less frozen, I
was able to ravel out the rope, put it into my
shoes, and use my wet socks inside my knicker-bockers,
where, though damp, they served to
break the wind. Then, tying the narrow strips
of flannel together, I bound up the tops of the
moccasins, Lapp fashion, and carried the bandage
on up over my knee, making a ragged
though most excellent puttee.</p>

<p>In order to run easily and fast with our dogs
in the spring of the year, when the weather is
usually warm, we wear very light clothing; thus
we do not perspire at midday and freeze at
night. It chanced that I had recently opened
a box of football garments which I had not seen
for twenty years. I had found my old Oxford
University running “shorts,” and a pair of
Richmond Football Club stockings of red,
yellow, and black, exactly as I wore them twenty
years ago. These, with a flannel shirt and
sweater, were all I now had left. Coat, hat,
gloves, oilskins&mdash;everything else&mdash;were gone, and
I stood there in that odd costume exactly as I
stood in the old days on a football field. These
garments, being very light, dried all the quicker
until afternoon; then nothing would dry any
more, everything freezing stiff.</p>

<p>My occupation till what seemed like midnight
was unravelling rope, and with this I padded
out my knickers inside and my shirt as well,
though it was a clumsy job, for I could not see
what I was doing. Now, getting my largest dog,
as big as a wolf and weighing ninety-two pounds,
I made him lie down in order that I could
cuddle around him. I then piled the three
skins so that I could lie on one edge, while the
other came just over my shoulders and head.</p>

<p>My own breath, collecting inside the newly-flayed
skin, must have had a soporific effect, for
I was soon fast asleep. One hand I had
plunged down inside the curled-up dog, but the
other hand, being gloveless, had frozen, and I
suddenly woke, shivering enough, I thought, to
break my pan. What I took to be the sun
was just rising, but I soon found it was the
moon, and then I knew it was about half past
twelve. The dog was having an excellent time;
he had not been cuddled up so warmly all the
winter. He resented my moving with low
growls, till he found it wasn’t another dog.</p>

<p>The wind was steadily driving me now towards
the open sea, where, short of a miracle, I could
expect nothing but death.</p>

<p>Still I had only this hope&mdash;that my pan would
probably be opposite another village, called
Goose Cove, at daylight, and might possibly be
seen from there. I knew that the <i>komatiks</i>
would be starting at daybreak over the hills for
a parade of Orangemen about twenty miles away.
I might, therefore, be seen as they climbed the
hills, though the cove does not open seaward.
So I lay down and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>I woke some time later with a sudden thought
in my mind that I must have a flag to signal
with. So I set to work at once in the dark to
disarticulate the legs of my dead dogs, which
were now frozen stiff, and seemed to offer the
only chance of forming a pole to carry a flag.</p>

<p>Cold as it was, I determined to sacrifice my
shirt for that purpose with the first streak of
daylight. It took a long time in the dark to get
the legs off, and when I had patiently marled
them together with old harness rope they formed
the heaviest and crookedest flag-post it has ever
been my lot to see. Still it had the advantage
of not being so cold to hold, because the skin on
the paws made it unnecessary to hold the frozen
meat with my bare hands.</p>

<p>What had awakened me this time, I found,
was that the pan had swung around and the
shelter made by my dogs’ bodies was on the
wrong side, for, though there was a very light air,
the evaporation it caused from my wet clothes
made quite a difference. I had had no food
since six o’clock the morning before, when I had
porridge and bread and butter. I had, however,
a rubber band on instead of one of my garters,
and I chewed that for twenty-four hours. It
saved me from thirst and hunger, oddly enough.
I did not drink from the ice of my pan,
for it was salt-water snow and ice. Moreover,
in the night the salt water had lapped up over
the edges, for the pan was on a level with the
sea. From time to time I heard the cracking
and grinding of the newly formed “slob,” and it
seemed that my little floe must inevitably soon
go to pieces.</p>

<p>At last the sun really did rise, and the time
came for the sacrifice of my shirt. I stripped,
and, much to my surprise and pleasure, did not
find it was half so cold as I had anticipated.
I now reformed my dog-skins, with the raw side
out, so that they made a kind of coat, quite
rivalling Joseph’s. But with the rising of the
sun the frost came out of the joints of my dogs’
legs, and the friction&mdash;caused, I suppose, by
waving it&mdash;made my flag-pole almost tie itself
in knots. Still, I could raise it three or four
feet above my head, which seemed very
important.</p>

<p>Now, however, I found that, instead of having
drifted as far as I had reckoned, I was only off
some cliffs called Ireland Head, near which
there is a little village looking seaward, whence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
I should certainly have been seen had the time
been summer. But as I had myself, earlier in
the season, been night-bound at the place, I had
learnt there was not a single soul living there
in the winter. The people had all, as usual,
migrated to their winter houses up the bay,
where they get together for schooling and social
purposes.</p>

<p>It was impossible to wave so heavy a flag as
mine all the time, and yet I dared not sit down,
for that might be the exact moment someone
would be in a position to see me from the hills.
The only thing in my mind was how long I
could stand up, and how long go on waving that
pole at the cliffs. Once or twice I thought I
saw men against their snowy faces, which I
judged were about five or six miles from me.
In reality, however, all the time I knew in my
heart of hearts that the black specks were only
trees. Once, also, I thought I saw a boat
approaching. A glittering object kept appearing
and disappearing on the water, but it was
merely a small piece of ice sparkling in the sun
as it rose on the surface.</p>

<p>Physically I felt as well as ever I did in my
life, and with the hope of a long sunny day I
felt sure I was good to last another twenty-four
hours if my ice-raft would only hold out. I
determined to kill a big Eskimo dog I had at
midday and drink his blood (only a few days
before I had been reading an account of the
sustaining properties of dogs’ blood in Dr.
Nansen’s book) if I survived the battle with
him.</p>

<p>I could not help feeling, even then, my
ludicrous position, and I thought if I ever got
ashore again I would have to laugh at myself
standing hour after hour waving my shirt at
those lofty cliffs, which seemed to assume a
kind of sardonic grin, so that I could almost
imagine they were laughing at me. I thought
of the good breakfast my colleagues were enjoying
just at the back of those same cliffs, and of
the snug fire and comfortable room which we
call our study.</p>

<p>I can honestly say that from first to last
not a single sensation of fear entered my mind,
even when struggling in the “slob” ice. It all
seemed so natural; I had been through the ice
half-a-dozen times before. Now I merely felt
sleepy, and the idea was very strong in my mind
that I should soon reach the solution of the
mysteries that I had been preaching about for
so many years.</p>

<p>It was a perfect morning, a cobalt sky and
an ultramarine sea, a golden sun, and an
almost wasteful extravagance of crimson pouring
over hills of purest snow, which caught
and reflected its glories from every peak
and crag. Between me and their feet lay
miles of rough ice, bordered with the black
“slob” formed during the night. Lastly,
there was my poor little pan in the fore-ground,
bobbing up and down on the edge
of the open sea, stained with blood, and littered
with carcasses and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. It was smaller than
last night; the edges, beating against the new
ice around, had heaped themselves up in fragments
that, owing to its diminutive size, it
could ill spare. I also noticed that the new ice
from the water melted under the dogs’ bodies
had also been formed at the expense of its thickness.
Five dogs and myself in a coloured football
costume and a blood-smeared dog-skin cloak,
with a grey flannel shirt on a pole of frozen dogs’
legs, completed the picture.</p>

<p>The sun was almost hot by now, and I was
conscious of a surplus of heat in my skin cloak.
I began to look longingly at one of my remaining
dogs, for an appetite will rise even on an
ice pan. The idea of eating made me think
of fire, so once again I inspected my matches.
Alas! the heads had entirely soaked off them
all, except three or four blue-top wax matches
which were in a paste. These I now laid out to
dry, and I searched around on my snow pan to
see if I could get a bit of transparent ice with
which to make a burning-glass, for I was pretty
sure that, with all the unravelled tow stuffed into
my nether garments and the fat of the dead
dogs, I could make smoke enough to be seen if
I could only get a light.</p>

<p>I had found a piece which it seemed might
answer the purpose, and had gone back to wave
my flag, which I did every two minutes, when
suddenly, for the second time, I thought I saw
the glitter of an oar. It did not seem possible,
however, for it must be remembered that it was
not water that lay between me and the land, but
“slob” ice, which, a mile or two inshore of me,
was very heavy. Even if people had seen me,
I did not think they could get through, though I
knew all of them would be trying. Moreover,
there was no smoke rising on the land to give
me hope that I had been seen. There had been
no gun flashes in the night, and I felt sure that,
had anyone seen me, there would have been a
bonfire on every hill to encourage me to keep
going. So I gave it up and went on with my
work. But the next time I went back to my
flag it seemed very distinct, and though it kept
disappearing as we rose and fell on the surface,
my readers can well imagine I kept my eyes in
that direction. Through my dark spectacles
having been lost, however, I was already partly
snow-blind.</p>

<p>I waved the flag as high as I could raise it in
a direction to be broadside towards those places
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
where I thought people might have gone out
around the ice after ducks, which is their main
occupation a little later in the year. I hoped
that they might then see my flag and come
straight on for me. At last, beside the glitter of
a white oar, I made out the black speck of a
hull. I knew then if the pan held out for
another hour that I should be all right.</p>

<p>With that strange perversity of the human
intellect, the first thing I thought of when I
realized that a rescue
boat was under way was
what trophies I could
carry with my luggage
from the pan! I pictured
the dog-bone flagstaff
adorning my study&mdash;the
dogs intervened,
however, and ate it later
on&mdash;and I thought of preserving
my ragged puttees
in my museum.</p>

<p>I could see that my
rescuers were frantically
waving, and when they
came within shouting
distance I heard someone
shout, “Don’t get
excited; keep on the
pan, where you are.” As
a matter of fact, they
were infinitely more
excited than I. Already
it seemed just as natural
to me now to be saved
as half an hour before
it seemed inevitable that
I should be lost. Had
my rescuers only known,
as I did, the sensations
of a bath in the ice
when you cannot dry
yourself afterwards, they
need not have expected
me to throw myself into
the water.</p>

<p>At last the boat came
up, crashing into my pan
with such violence that
I was glad enough to
catch hold of the bow,
being more or less
acquainted by now with the frail constitution
of my floe, and being well aware it was
not adapted for collisions. Moreover, I felt for
the pan, for it had been a good and faithful
friend to me.</p>

<p>A hearty handshake all round and a warm cup
of tea&mdash;thoughtfully packed in a kettle&mdash;inside,
and we hoisted in my remaining dogs and
instantly started back, for even then a change of
wind might have penned the boat with ice,
which would have cost us dearly. Indeed, the
men thought we could not return, and we
started for an island, in which direction the way
was all open.</p>

<p class="caption">“I COULD SEE THAT MY RESCUERS WERE FRANTICALLY WAVING.”</p>
</div>

<p>There were not only five Newfoundland
fishermen at the oars, but five men with Newfoundland
muscles in their backs and arms and
five as brave hearts as ever beat in the bodies
of human beings. So we presently changed our
course and forced our way through to the shore.</p>

<p>To my intense astonishment they told me
that the night before four men had been out on
a point of land, from which the bay is visible,
cutting some dead harp seals out from a store.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
The ice had been extraordinarily hard, and it
had taken them till seven o’clock at night to cut
out twenty-four seals. Just at the very moment
before they left for home, my pan of ice had
drifted out clear of the island called Hare Island,
and one of them, with his keen fisherman’s eyes,
had seen something unusual. They at once
returned to their village, saying there was a man
on a pan, but they had been discredited, for
the people there thought it could only be
the top of some tree.</p>

<p>All the time I had been driving along I knew
well that there was one man on the coast who
had a good spy-glass, and that he had twelve
children, among them some of the hardiest
young men on the coast. Many times my
thoughts had wandered to him, for his sons are
everywhere, hunting seals and everything else.
It was his sons, and another man with them, who
saw me, and were now with him in the boat.
The owner of the spy-glass told me he got up
instantly in the middle of tea on hearing the news,
and hurried over the cliff to the look-out with
his glass. Immediately, dark as it was, he made
out that there really
was a man out on
the ice. Indeed, he
saw me wave my
hands every now and
again towards the
shore. By a process
of reasoning very
easy on so unfrequented
a shore, they
immediately knew
who it was, but tried
to argue themselves
out of their conviction.
They went
down at once to try
and launch a boat,
but found it absolutely
impossible.
Miles of ice lay between
them and me,
the heavy sea was
hurling great blocks
on the land-wash,
and night was already
falling, with the wind
blowing hard on
shore. These brave
fellows, however, did
not sit down idly.
The whole village
was aroused,
messengers dispatched at once along the coast,
and look-outs told off to all the favourable
points, so that while I considered myself a
laughing-stock, waving my flag at those irresponsive
cliffs, there were really men’s eyes watching
from them all the time.</p>

<p>Every soul in the village was on the beach as
we neared the shore, and everybody wanted to
shake hands when I landed. Even with the
grip that one after another gave me, some no
longer trying to keep back the tears, I did not
find out that my hands were frost-bitten&mdash;a fact
I have not been slow to appreciate since. A
weird sight I must have looked as I stepped
ashore&mdash;tied up in rags stuffed out with oakum,
wrapped in the blood-stained skins of dogs, with
no hat, coat, or gloves, and only a short pair of
knickers on! It must have seemed to some of
them as if the Old Man of the Sea had landed.</p>

<p>No time was wasted before a pot of tea was
exactly where I wanted it to be, and some hot
stew was locating itself where I had intended
an hour before that the blood of one of my
remaining dogs should have gone.</p>

<p>Rigged out in the
warm garments that
fishermen wear, I
started with a large
team as hard as I
could race for hospital,
for I had learnt
that the news had
gone over that I was
lost. It was soon
painfully impressed
upon me that I could
not much enjoy the
ride; I had to be
hauled like a log up
the hills, my feet
being frost-bitten so
that I could not
walk. Had I guessed
this before I might
have avoided much
trouble.</p>

<p>We all love life,
and I was glad to be
back once more with
a new lease of it
before me. My colleague
soon had me
“fixed up,” and I
was presently enjoying
a really refreshing
sleep.</p>

<h3>UNIQUE POST-OFFICE IN NEBRASKA.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> years ago, a traveller recounting his experiences
of the early days of the city of Nebraska,
U.S.A., says that on arriving at the odd collection of
shanties that then represented the beginnings of the city,
he inquired for the post-office, and was referred to an
old chap sitting on a log. Of this man he further
inquired where he could find the post-office, as he
expected a letter. The old chap removed his sombrero,
and, fumbling inside it, produced the expected
letter. Since then Nebraska has grown into considerable
importance as the capital of the State of
Nebraska.&mdash;“<span class="small">THE CAPTAIN.</span>”</p>

<h3>CURIOUS FISHING SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="upper-case">In</span> British Columbia the Indians ceremoniously
go out to meet the first salmon, and in flattering
voices try to win their favour by calling them all
chiefs. Every spring in California the Karaks used
to dance for salmon. Meanwhile one of their number
secluded himself in the mountains and fasted for ten
days. Upon his return he solemnly approached the
river, took the first salmon of the catch, ate some of
it, and with the remainder lighted a sacrificial fire.
The same Indians laboriously climbed to the mountain-top
after the poles for the spearing-booth, being
convinced that if they were gathered where the salmon
were watching no fish would be caught. In Japan,
among the primitive race of the Ainos, even the
women left at home are not allowed to talk, lest the
fish may hear and disapprove, while the first fish is
always brought in through a window instead of a
door, so that other fish may not see.&mdash;“<span class="small">TIT-BITS.</span>”</p>

<h3>FLEMISH FISHERWOMEN.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the coasts of Holland, Belgium, and Northern
France fisherwomen are a familiar sight, with
their great hand-nets and quaint costumes. Many
of the towns have distinctive costumes by which
their women can be recognised anywhere. Those of
Maria-Kirke, near Ostend, wear trousers and loose
blouses, while their heads and shoulders are covered by
shawls. They carry their nets into the sea, and scoop
up vast quantities of shrimps and prawns, with an occasional
crab or lobster and many small fish. They often wade
out till the water is up to their necks, and they remain
for hours at a time in water above their knees, rarely
returning until their baskets are full.&mdash;“<span class="small">WOMAN’S LIFE.</span>”</p>

<h3>CANADA FOR THE SPORTSMAN.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="upper-case">Canada</span> is an ideal country for the sportsman. Notwithstanding
its rapid commercial development, it
still has thousands of miles of wild and unexplored land,
where man has seldom or never trodden. Even in the
Eastern provinces, within a very short distance of civilization,
wild animals of many kinds&mdash;moose, caribou, elk,
deer, and even bears&mdash;still abound. From the Atlantic
coast to the Pacific slope, from the international boundary
line north to the Arctic circle, Canada offers magnificent
opportunities to the sportsman, whatever his tastes may
be; big and small game-shooting, fishing, camping,
canoeing.&mdash;“<span class="small">FRY’S MAGAZINE.</span>”</p>

<h3>THE GEESE OF NIEDER-M&Ouml;RLEN.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the little Hessean village of Nieder-M&ouml;rlen, between
Giessen and Frankfort, a strange scene may be
witnessed every evening at half-past five. Some two
thousand geese, which have spent the day on the river’s
bank below the village, at a given signal from their
leaders make their way homewards with much pomp and
circumstance and raucous noise. The strangest part of
the proceeding is seen when they reach the village street
and, without any guidance or driving, waddle each into
its own yard for the night. Like so many squads they
break off in their dozens from the main body, knowing
instinctively their owners’ door, and with solemn gait
enter in as though conscious of their own innate cleverness.&mdash;Mr.
A.H. Ross, in “<span class="small">THE STRAND MAGAZINE</span>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Near</span> Dome Rock, Colorado, thirty-two
miles up Platte Canyon from
Denver, is situated one of the most
wonderful balanced rocks in the
world. This rock, as will be seen
from the illustration, is poised with very little
of its surface touching the ground. The most
peculiar feature about the boulder is the
fact that it does not rest on a flat surface of
soft earth, but is perched out on an incline with
a very steep angle. The slope on which it
stands, moreover, is of smooth, solid rock, too
slippery for anyone to walk up, and how the
boulder maintains its position is a mystery.</p>

<p>Church bells and church plate, as related in a
recent <span class="smcap">Wide World</span> article, are not the only
kinds of buried treasure of which there are
traditions in Worcestershire. Mr. J.W. Willis
Bund, in his “Civil War in Worcestershire,”
says: “There is hardly a family who possessed
a landed estate at the time of the Civil War
that has not some legend of concealed treasure.
For instance, the Berkeleys, of Spetchley, say
their butler, to save the family plate, hid it
under one of the elms in the avenue. The
butler was wounded, and tried with his last
breath to confide his secret to a member of
the family, but could get no further than
’plate,’ ‘elm,’ ‘avenue,’ and died; so that
the plate remains hidden to this day.” The
occasion upon which the Berkeley plate was
hidden was the sack and burning of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
family mansion at Spetchley, upon the eve
of the Battle of Worcester, by the Scots troops
who accompanied Charles II. from the North.
Sir Robert Berkeley was a devoted Royalist and
had suffered much for
the King, and members
of his family were serving
in the Royal army; but
the Scots, who had fought
upon both sides, were
not careful to distinguish
between friend and foe.
The only portion of
Spetchley which escaped
the flames was the
stabling. Here Cromwell
made his head-quarters,
and after the war Judge
Berkeley converted the
building into a house
and lived there for many
years. The elm avenue
in Spetchley Park,
where the plate was
buried, still exists, and
is one of the finest in
Worcestershire. For the
photograph given above

<p>The curious little
building seen in the
next photograph
stands at the end of
a private walk on the
shores of the River
Orwell, in Suffolk. It
is known as the “Cat
House,” for the
reason that, in the
“good old times,” a
white cat used to be
exhibited at a window
visible from the river
as a signal to smugglers,
who flourished
in the locality. When
the animal was shown,
the “Free-Traders,”
as the contrabandists
were euphemistically
called, knew that the
coast was clear, and
promptly sailed up
and landed their
cargo, secure from
the attentions of the “preventives.” Near
“Cat House” is Downham Reach, which was
the scene of some of Margaret Catchpole’s most
exciting adventures.</p>

<i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The accompanying photograph depicts a
terrific oil fire, which occurred on the night
of June 23rd, 1908, at Warren, Pennsylvania.
The conflagration started through a tank being
struck by lightning, and in a very short time
twenty-five oil-holders, large and small, together
with the wax-house, were destroyed. The fire
burned for nearly twenty-four hours, and its
fierceness is almost impossible to conceive.
The total loss incurred was something like one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The extraordinary-looking dwelling seen in
the next picture was built to exactly resemble
a steamship’s bridge, with chart-room and other
appurtenances all complete. This curious erection
is situated at Algorta, near Bilbao, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
North of Spain, and is called “Casa-Barco,”
or “house-boat.” It was
probably built by a retired sea-captain,
who felt like a fish out of
water until he had provided for
himself the same environment to
which he had been used during his
active career at sea. One can
imagine the old gentleman taking
his evening walk to and fro along
the lofty bridge, scanning the surrounding
country with a sailor’s
eye, and half inclined now and
then to ring for “more speed,” or
to send an order down the tube to
the steersman.</p>

<p>The cat seen in the next photograph
was the pet of the crew of
the ill-fated whaler <i>Windward</i>,
which was wrecked in Baffin’s Bay
last season. After the disaster
pussy had a long, cold voyage in
the open boats in which the ship-wrecked
men pulled&mdash;amidst ice-bergs,
snow, and tossing seas&mdash;for
over five hundred miles, encountering
dangers and adventures galore,
till after three weeks of fearful
exposure and hardship they were
picked up by the whaler <i>Morning</i>,
in which the correspondent who
sent us the picture was a passenger.
“Pussy then made up for

a hot-water bottle.”</p>

<p>On the foreshore of the Mata Beach,
Mangapai, New Zealand, stands the
remarkable rock shown above. It is an
almost perfect sphere of hard blue
rock, shot with white quartz, of an
entirely different formation from any
other known rocks in the district. The
mystery is, of course, to know how
it reached its present position on
the soft sandstone of the beach.
Popular opinion is that in distant ages
it was shot from a volcano, since
extinct. The rock, which probably
weighs twenty tons, rests in a cup like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
depression in the sandstone formation on which
it stands, and is so nicely poised that four strong
men, encircling it with their arms and all pushing
one way, can set it spinning on its base.</p>

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
